	  According to the general rule, <em>p5</em> divided by two
	  determines <em>severity</em>.  Severity can be taken or
	  mitigated with appropriate skill at base difficulty 20.
	  Determine whether it can be worsened, the full effect is 10.
	  E.g. a severity 5 implies difficulty 25 and only reaching a
	  result of 15 mean full severity and depending on
	  circumstances, a 5 result could mean up to twice the
	  severity effects.
	</p>
	<p>
	  Personal is usually physical penalty.  Equipment is usually
	  loss as percentage of net value, e.g. -5 is 5% of value
	  loss.  Value is one traveller's net worth. Transport is time
	  loss in percentage.  E.g. -5 is 5% time loss until
	  compensated.  Plant may mean wilderness skill failure, such
	  as Foraging, with effect equivalent to time or value as
	  before.  Animal or human encounters are effectively time
	  loss or wounds.  The first one through rhetorics, discussing
	  mute points, detainment, etc.. The second one through
	  exchanging non-lethal blows and being stopped at the right
	  point.
	</p>
	<p>
	  Severity will be 5-added, which is why group travel is
	  generally preferable.  GM will "spread" penalties.

	  Use 5 point classification for <em>Standard, Common,
	  Uncommon, Rare</em>, assuming the skill is used to find the
	  most valuable herb.  Standard herbs are those used for teas,
	  tasty chewing, etc. and worth little more than maybe a beer
	  even in large quantities.  They provide a bonus of up to 5
	  for motivation, supress up to 5 physical penalty for a few
	  minutes, etc.  Even these small herbs may cause lesser
	  effects over time or even dependency.  Think tea or raw
	  coffee.
	</p>
	<p>
	  Add all herbs in one category and randomize.  Ater that
	  determine season.  Two month out of season reduces potency
	  by half, because the herb is either not ripe or already
	  withered.  More than that potency is zero.  In border times
	  give 10% for each day.  I.e. ten days late or early equals
	  0%/50% potency and ten days in (out) season equals 50%/100%.
