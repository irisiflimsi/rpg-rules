        <p>
          The attributes and descriptons remain in place as Harnworld
          requires them (at least for some characters).  In other
          words, without them, a character designed toward a specific
          career would be incomplete in the setting.  They are also
          not transformed in any way.  Generation of values can be
          used as suggested.  <em>Relationship and Loyalty</em> for
          contacts are descriptive only.
        </p>
        <p>
          Sunsigns are treated as direct modifiers, where they have
          a numeric value.
        </p>
        <h3 id="char-2">Page 7-8, 10</h3>
        <p>
          The attributes described are translated (linearly) into the
          range -15 to 15.  <em>Moraliy</em> is dropped.  Generation
          of values can be used as suggested.
        </p>
        <h3 id="char-3">Page 9, 11-12</h3>
        <p>
          Table results from these page are used purely in their
          descriptive sense.  Whether they retroractively have any
          effect on other attributes is a choice that can be made
          during character creation and according to the severity or
          interpretation of the result that you want to portait.
          <em>Piety</em> is turned into a skill (q.v.) for each deity.
          For a single deity the value can be chosen or generated as
          suggested.  All others are 0 initially.

          <li>
            <b>Level 0:</b> NN knows that the reigion exist but cannot
            separate it from other convocations.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Level 5:</b> Lip service payed to the religion and
            ability to separate it from other major faiths.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Level 10:</b> The main tenants of the religion are
            known and followed on individual level.  Sects or heresies
            are not considered.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Level 15:</b> The religion is quoted often and other
            faiths routinely treated underhanded.  Proselytizing is
            rarely attempted.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Level 20:</b> At this level the adherent is actively
            seeking to further the tenants of the religion outside of
            his immediate domain.  Distinction between inner-religion
            minutiae are important.

          <li>
            <b>Level 25:</b> Heresy is abhorred more than other
            religions.  Support for the religion takes precendents
            over other interests almost always.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Level 30:</b> The adherent is a prophet for the
            religion and accepts otherwise serious consequences for
            following details of his faith.  May invent rituals and
            the like.

        <p>
          The occupations of the table on this page serve as skills
          and the listed "old" skills serve only as descriptive
          values.
        </p>
        <h3 id="char-5">Page 16, 19</h3>
        <p>
          <em>Automatic</em> skills are determined accoridng to the
          appropriate skill section (q.v.) and <em>Occupation</em>
          skills work as transformed for the previous page.  They open
          as 20 for the chosen occupation.  <em>Family</em> skills for
          parents in the same occupation add 2 points, while for a
          different occupation they add 5.  (This is effectively
          <em>Row-5-addition</em> of a 0 skill level.)
          <em>Optional</em> skills are as they exist, but new skills
          may be "invented"; the scope is at GM discretion.  Any
          reasoonable skill can be improved by 5 for each option point
          (OP) through <em>Row-5-addition</em>; this includes OPs
          gained for Veterans.  Militia skills are explained elsewhere
          as are psionics.
        </p>
        <h3 id="char-6">Page 20-22</h3>
        <p>
          Rules on these page are completely dropped currently.
          Generation of values can be used as suggested.
        </p>
        <h3 id="char-6">Page 23-27</h3>
        <p>
          Each clerical occupation is treated as a separate
          occupation, with the "old" skills being used in a
          descriptive sense.  The same is true for the Shek-Pvar.
          <em>Chantry Applications</em> are dropped.  Treat Sunsigns
          as direct modifiers from the <em>Convocational
          Sunsign Modifiers</em> for magic invocations.  Magic does
          not work along spell lines (q.v.).  Each military occupation
          is treated as a separate occupation as well.
        </p>

      <div class="container">
        <h1 id="skills">Skills</h1>
        <p>
          Available skills are according to the occupations listed
          above, determined by Harnworld professions.  More skills may
          be created according to players' or GM's wishes.  A
          selection of often used skills that do not easily relate to
          occupations is given below
        </p>
        <p>
          Situations which require rolls are announced by the GM with
          a general description of what needs to be resolved.  Players
          will then argue, which skills could be applicable and the GM
          will give a corresponding percentage of how much they apply.
        </p>
        <p>
          For example, an assessemnt of the correct political relation
          between to rival noble families may be Herald/75% and
          Knight/50%, and Mercantyler/25%.
        </p>
        <p>
          Now roll for all applicable skills you have a value in.
          (Remember that a base 0 always applies.)  In the example
          above, the mercantyler has a 1 in 4 chance of using his
          mercantyler skill, say 12, and a 3 in 4 chance of using his
          knight skill 0.  All skills which were succeessfully rolled
          for are added up through row 3 from the main rules additions
          table (repeated here).  The end result is the skill to roll
          against.

          Humans can accelerate and decalerate as 3 m/s each second.
          Turning options are in parts of a full circle (centered around
          the direction of travel).  E.g. at 3 m/s this means 60&#176;
          off the direction of travel on either side per second.  For the
          sake of playability variance in this should be suppressed,
          although a 20% spread (for a 10 level difference) with Agility
          modification could be appropriate.

          Fatigue is acrued at the 10 points per minute (or 1 per second)
          for the generated maximum sprint speed. Fractions (which cannot
          exceed 1) of that speed generate the corresponding fractional
          fatigue rate. E.g. running at half the maximum speed gives 5 points
          per minute (or 1 per 12 seconds).  Only simple fractions are allowed.

          The listed weight can be lifted without dedicated tools.  At that point
          any activity is at -10.  This scales linearly down or up.  That means that
          any fraction of the weight carried also incurs the same fraction of
          -10 as penalty. Any multiple carried also gives the corresponding multiple
          as penalty.  Note that with certain penalties usually trivial activities
          (i.e. no roll required) become difficult, for instance not stumbling. 
        </p>
        <p>
          Still without tools, activity with both hands is impossible. Freeing one 
          hand incurs twice the penalty and assumes that the weight is liftable that
          way.

          Learning is modelled by an active roll with level 0 against
          a passive level of the current skill. Note that rolling 10
          non-stop events can be shortened into rolling a 1 with a d10.
          Learning is applicable to attributes but the active roll is
          level -15.
        </p>
        <p>
          Such rolls may be made once a month in which the skill was
          used reasonably often. Usually only three such rolls apply.
          A teacher can also be combined with his own skill reduced by
          10 through <em>Row-5-addition</em>. This assumes that the
          teacher is available almost always during that time.
        </p>
        <p>
          Example: Suppose your skill is at 5 and your teacher has a
          skill of 12. According to the rules, we should first take the
          highest of the two parameters to be combined into a single
          skill roll, that is 0 and 2 (12 - 10).  Remember your active
          level is 0 in this situation.  Taking the difference of, we
          have a column index of 2 into the combination table and we
          read in the fifth row a 5, which will be added to 2 (the
          higher of the two numbers) to yield a 7. That is the active
          skill level to roll against your current skill level (5) to 
          improve.  We are pitting a 7 against a 5 with roughly a 70%
          chance of success and upon success the skill level is increased
          to 6.

          The following table is rolled for each combatant, adding any
          bonuses and subtracting any penalties.  The time is the number
          of seconds, which it takes to achieve the set <em>wound level</em>
          zero.  The <em>wound level</em> can be set higher, but then this
          number is subtracted. Estimated time and level can be played out
          against each other.  The intended <em>wound level</em> must be
          declared before the roll and in multiples of 5.  Once a (rolled)
          progression has reached its goal, a new skill roll is necessary.
        </p>
        <p>
          Any effects from wounds or other external influences in combat are
          applied immediately to pending progressions.  At the actors choice
          it can offset the goal or the time.  To prevent players from immediately
          aborting "bad" rolls, mandatory secret rolls by the GM can be used.
        </p>
        <p>
          If so desired, the intended wound level can be randomized in the usual
          way.  This can not be modified except through <em>control</em>.
          Alternatively, if time is fixed, a best effort attack can be made. For
          instance, if an opponent was downed and will get up within a few seconds
          and the bonus shall be used for better or worse.  In that case always
          spread the actual wound level around the least favorable time for the
          attacker.
