        <p>
          Available skills are listed below and are deteremined
          by Harnworld professions and some additional properties
          associated with the setting.  Situations which require 
          rolls are announced by the GM with a general description
          of what needs to be resolved.  Players will then argue,
          which skills could have a say in this and the GM will
          give a corresponding percentage of how much they apply.
        </p>
        <p>
          For example, an assessemnt of the correct political relation
          between to rival noble families may be Herald/75% and
          Knight/50%, and Mercantyler/25%.
        </p>
        <p>
          Now roll for all applicable skills you have a value in.
          (Remember that a base 0 always applies.)  In the example
          above, the mrecantyler has a 1 in 4 chance of using with his
          skill, say 12, and a 3 in 4 chance of using his knight 
          skill 0. All skills which are succeesses are added up through
          row 3 from the main rules (repeated here). The end result is
          skill to roll against.
