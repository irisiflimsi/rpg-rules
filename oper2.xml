          Humans still live on well-populated Earth (5.000.000.000)
          but Earth is striken with plagues, environmental hazards and
          petty wars.  Mars has been colonized and has claimed
          independence since 30 years ago.  Originally a generic
          scientific undertaking, its population (500.000.000) focuses
          on terraforming.  Mars does not have the gravity to bind a
          breatheable atmossphere.  Scattered across the asteroid belt
          and moons of the outer planets, the human belters
          (50.000.000) live.  Ganymede is the largest hub with about
          5.000.000 residents.

          The solar system is mainly according to current state of
          physics.  The speed of light is a hard boundary for travel
          and space is extremely vast.  That being said, certain
          creative extensions are made.  Mainly space propulsion is
          relative easy to come by, the so-called”Epstein-Drive” or
          sideric drive.  But there are no flashy laser weapons or
          artificial gravity.  Getting material and people of the
          Earth (and to a lesser degree Mars) is still a very
          expensive thing.

        <p>
          Society on the outer moons and the belt is similar to the
          wild west, but on a higher technologic level.  Information
          takes hours to travel from one planet to the next and ships
          may take days.  Mars is a centralistic, technocracy and
          Earth the usual, squabbling league of nations.  However, the
          UN has achieved an authority level as the EU government has
          in the year 2000, probably a bit more.  In particular it has
          troops, nominally only to use them in Space.

          Big cooperations spanning the planets dominate commerce.
          The interdependencies are hard to gauge and change often, as
          companies divide into smaller units to avoid taxes, press
          smaller countries into servive, try to avoid bad press and
          so on.  The last “monopoly bust” was just 10 years ago, when
          a Belt-mining company was split into three.  Humans on earth
          have a life-expectancy of 100 years, on Mars 75 and belters

            <em>Name:</em> Whole classes are listed with a parameter
            range in which to choose from.

          <p>
            <em>I:</em> Impact is equivalent to a calibre and can be
            treated as interchangeable between different
            manufacturers.  Converting bullets from one class to
            another and lowering the impact rating requires a
            gunsmith.  Impact has the point aspect only.  At higher
            levels the distinction between different aspects becomes
            moot.
          </p>
          <p>
            <em>RC:</em> is the range class, explained in a later
            table.
          </p>
          <p>
            <em>WT:</em> Weight of the unloaded handgun (or with a
            single bullet in the chamber) is calculated with the given
            formula and given in grams.  The weight of a single bullet
            Impact x 20 grams and called <em>IW</em> (Impact Weight).
          </p>
          <p>
            <em>Price:</em> An abstract unit currently, for comparison
            only equate this to US Dollars or Euros in the year 2000.
            The cost for Ammunition is its Impact rating per bullet in
            units.
          </p>
          <p>
            <em>Clip:</em> show the range of ammo batches available.
            They only come in multiiples shown in paranthesis.  The
            weight of a clip is the number of rounds it contains
            multiplied by the bullets' weight.
          </p>
          <p>
            <em>ROF:</em> The rate of fire is bullets fired per
            second, which all must be aimed.  The rate of fire can be
            arbitrarily adjusted in the given range, autoburst and
            other contemporary restrictions no longer apply.
          </p>
        </div>
        <p>
          The ML for any offense is decreased by two (2) for each
          bullet fired above the first.  That is, a character firing 3
          bullets per second subtracts 4 from ML for all attack rolls.
        </p>
        <p>
          Note that a Small gun can be fired with one hand and
          secondary hand penalty applies.  A Medium gun can be fired
          with one hand at -5 penalty and twice the multiple target
          penalty and RC reduced by one.  A Heavy gun cannot be fired
          with one hand.  A heavy gun needs stationary bracing, if
          this is not available, a -5 penalty and twice the multiple
          target penalty apply and RC reduced to three (3).  A
          superheavy weapon needs a stationary mount and if only
          bracing is available, the -5 penalty and twice the multiple
          target penalty apply.  RC is reduced to (3).  Light
          artillery cannot be fired without stationary mount.  If it
          is discharged none-the-less, only the first shot is at -5
          with RC2, while everything else are “wild” results at best.
        </p>
        <p>
          All weapons fall into the range classes below.  Sometimes
          weapons have properties of lower range classes, when
          inferior conditions exist, usually protective measures
          against recoil.

          All Medium Guns provide a Defense ML modifier of Club, all
          Small Guns as as a Knife.  Heavy Guns and beyond usually
          provide cover and cannot be used as Defensive weapon.
        </p>
        <p>
          If desired, roll a “self-attack” by the used weapon to
          determine if a Jam or other malfunction occurs.  Any Damage
          taken precludes further operation of the weapon until
          gunsmithing is applied.  “Minor” damage can be repaired in
          the field with general purpose tools.
        </p>
        <p>
          With the advent of weapons with high penetration, cover
          becomes more important and the thicker, the better.  The
          table shows the protective values for material cover per
          centimetre thickness.  Other materials can be modelled to
          scale their protective value with density.

          Specialised ammunition may be used instead of the standard
          ammunition.  A Gunsmith can provide these.  Some Examples:
        </p>
        <div class="explain">
          <p>
            <em>Advanced Energy Transfer:</em> AET ammunition is
            available for small and medium guns only.  Add +5 to the
            wound points; this will aggrevate the wound level as well.
            Cost is 30 times normal.
          </p>
          <p>
            <em>Armour Piercing:</em> AP ammunition are designed to
            maximise penetration through hard cover.  Available for
            small through heavy guns.  Add +5 to Strike Impact when
            comparing against armour, but reduce the wound level by 10
            (effectively by 5).  Cost is 3 times normal.
          </p>
          <p>
            <em>Glaser:</em> Frangible ammunition that comprises
            numerous tiny pellets inside a thin metal jacket.  The
            drawback of this round is that it has poor penetration.
            Available for Small Guns only.  Reduce Strike Impact by
            five (5) before comparing against armour, but add twenty
            (20) (effectively 15) to wound level.  Cost is 15 times
            normal.
          </p>
          <p>
            <em>Rubber:</em> These bullets cause Blunt Trauma instead
            of puncture and any Wound level caused (after armour
            reduction) is further reduced by five (5).
          </p>
        </div>
        <p>
          When a clip is out of ammunition, it takes a Grope action to
          load another cartridge for Small guns, Subtract 20 for
          Medium Guns and 40 for Heavy Guns, 100 for Superheavy
          Weapons, and at least 200 for artillery.  This all assumes
          that the next cartridge or cask is close by, i.e. within 5
          ft.
        </p>
        <p>
          For stationary targets special equipment exists to improve
          the aiming bonus, by spending 1 second per bonus point,
          limited by the eyesight skill value.  Note that military
          grade equipment also includes guided missiles, this is not
          meant here.
        </p>
        <p>
          When firing at a human, any Wound exceeding 4 x Size can be
          considered passing through to the next target.  This value
          is after deducting armour values, but do not calculate those
          twice, i.e. for exiting armour on the other side.
        </p>
        <h4>Armour</h4>

          All explosions inflict Impact with different aspects.  The
          indicated value is inflicted at the center and reduced by 1
          for each foot of distance.  Cover applies and Penetrating
          hits.  On the other hand, all exposed Main Locations are
          affected likewise, making explosives very dangerous.
          Special care needs to be taken when damaging walls, in
          underwater environments and other circumstances that may
          increase or decrease effects.  In general, explosions
          continue around corners with a penalty of one (1) for each
          10° off course from center.  Fragments (P aspect) do not go
          around corners.  Otherwise, Explosives are treated as
          missiles with a duration of 1 second.  Fuses for throwing
          are standard and can be set to arbitrary values but default
          to 4 seconds.  Note that thrown objects are in the air for
          the time mentioned in the table.  Straight throws are
          possible up to 10 meters in 1s on Earth (1g) but exact or
          optimal values can only be calculated with mathematics skill
          or similar. Otherwise randomize.  Grenade launchers boost
          throwing strength by 20 points

            <em>Scope:</em> A scope increases EYE by 5 to 20.  The
            low-end variant costs 50, while the high-end is 400.  Each
            weighs 200g.  Note that special medium guns also exist as
            variants that have more or less infinitely extended range
            penalties for RC3.  They cost 10 times as much as the
            normal version.  These are sniper versions and they
            invariably require scopes.

          <p>
            <em>Night Vision:</em> These Goggles can be mounted to a

            due to low light by up to 20.  Imaging itself however
            causes a -5 penalty.  A typical night vision google weighs
            just 100g, costs 350 and uses a standard, small battery.

          <p>
            <em>Sound Suppressor:</em> These are mounted to the muzzle
            and reduce sounds by 5 points.  A typical sound suppressor
            weighs just 100g and costs 350.  Special, powered
            silencers exist that reduce shot gun noise by 10 points
            but they cost 1000.

            half-efficient Night Vision in the Dark.  They also allow
            detection behind thin covering.  A typical thermal scanner

          Medicine is greatly improved compared to Hârn.  With the
          proper tools and medicine, Physician skills may easily be
          improved by almost arbitrary bonuses.  The cost for the
          bonus is listed in the table and applied through Row-5
          Addition.  There are more ways of dealing with wounds that
          are only short of regrowing a limb.  Any destruction level
          wound remains untreatable, but other than that.  The costs
          involve dedicated hand-held equipment, an Emergency Care
          Unit, to specifically created operation robots and regrow
          facilities.  Thus Juryn, the famed doctor with a skill of
          25, can treat a wound in his field of expertise with
          25+<sub>5</sub>10 width readily available medication and
          procedures.  That will cost 1000 in materials and does not
          include the amount that Jurin himself puts on the bill for
          his patient.  But the arm that was torn off by a robot in
          the blink of an eye, including bad lesions and other
          nerve-wrecking damage with a wound level of 20, will
          probably heal nicely.

            <em>Tonage</em> is usually weight in tons and linear to
            the cubic meters of enclosed space.  Every cubic meter of
            steel plated ship weight 500kg.  When designing Tonnage
            consider space port sizes.

            <em>Structure</em> is the amount of g the ship can sustain
            without breaking apart.  Lift-off is usually at 1 g plus
            the stellar body’s gravity one lifts off from.  As the

            <em>Planetary shuttles</em> are used to ferry passengers
            and goods from and to planets with more than marginal
            gravity.  In the solar system these are only Mars and
            Earth.
          </p>
          <p>
            <em>Space shuttles</em> are the ferries between moons and
            asteroids, which do not need to fly through gravitational
            fields.
          </p>
          <p>
            <em>Freighters</em> are civilian ships between inner and
            outer planets and their moons, they are the most varied
            ships in the solar system.  Some include smaller ferry
            boats, but this is rare.
          </p>
          <p>
            <em>Gunboats</em> are fast ships but not armned too
            heavily.  Warships are the most heavily armed and costly
            of all ships.  Carriers transport their own tonage in
            gunboats.

          Spaceships are built in compartments of approximately 10T
          each.  Thus any hull breach will immediately result in
          bulkheads to shut the affected areas down.  Depending on the
          affected area, they may or may not continue to be
          functional.  Ships are organized in such a way that most
          such cells can continue to operate the remaining functional
          cells.  Some jamming weapons may prevent that.  The fusion
          reactor is 10T minimum for planetary vessels and
          0.05T/(1g*1T) otherwise.  Thus the size scales with maximum
          thrust and tonage.  If this receives a substantial hit, an
          explosion consuming 1km radius per ton is likely to occur.
        </p>
        <p>
          The number given in the price category are interplanetary
          credits.  Ships cost 4000 per ton.  Heavy artillery mounted
          to space stations cost 200 times their impact rating.  For
          any construction that needs to be able to withstand
          accelaration, use the price multiplier from the table.

          The costs are “end-consumer” prices and selling equipment is
          rarely possible and usually at less than half price,
          particularly for non-pristine equipment.  Additionally, all
          economic rules apply, such as demand and supply rules,
          cornering markets, trade tariffs, etc.  Assume that the
          prices are valid at Earth space-ports under free market
          conditions.  Buying in the belt or on Mars may see stiff
          increases or occasional drops, when contraband or plunder is
          being sold.  Use Street-wise as skill (among others) to
          trade profitably.

          Fuel and general maintenance of a space ship is generally
          1/100 of its build cost per day.  Cost when not travelling
          are assumed equivalent to travel costs, as port fees need to
          be payed and maintenance is actually done.  Destruction,
          such as that inflicted diuring space combat, can often not
          be repaired and instead requires rebuilding.
        </p>
        <h3 id="ports">Spaceports</h3>
        <p>
          On Earth there are no space ports that allow more than 1 kT
          to start.  Most will only allow 100 T.  (1T = 1000 kg.) Mars
          has one port for 1 kT and 2 for 300 T.  Spaceports on moons
          and spacedocks are usually arbitrary size, Luna is the prime
          example, with a gravity of 1/6.  There are three space ports
          in orbit around Earth.  They provide ferry services to the
          surface.  There is no spaceport around Mars.
        </p>
        <p>
          Some spaceport make a fuss about actual tonagr for
          freighters landing and lifting off and armour plating
          increasing weight and such.  Pilots trying to test the
          limits of a space port may find themselves grounded or
          worse: they need to jettison contents or parts from their
          ship.  Docking and undocking fees follow a quadratic law
          with respect to tonage, so the larger freighters tend to use
          shuttles and rather lose time than too much money on goods
          in transfer.  This makes most space ports busy places.

        <h3 id="destruction">Mass Destruction</h3>
        <p>
          Nuclear, Chemical and Biological Weapons are banned and
          strictly controlled by all involved parties able to produce
          them.  They are known to exist in forms that eradicate a
          non-separated population within weeks, or eradicate a cubic
          voulume of 1 cubic kilometer with “grievous” consequences in
          the surrounding volume.  None of these weapons produce
          relevant damage in empty space.  The explosion radius of a
          nuclear weapon is 1/10th of that in an atmossphere.  Effects
          on Mars have not been studied.
        </p>
        <p>
          The most devastating weapon in space combat that is deemed
          acceptable by interplanetary law are autonomous, guided
          missiles.  They are guided by an AI and a heat-sensor that
          locks onto a heat signature and accelerates at 20g.  This
          makes them extremely hard to deflect (but scattering fine
          debries at smaller velocities have been known to work, when
          the missile has sufficient speed.  Most ships automatically
          close down all bulkheads when such a weapon comes within
          sensor range immediately and will maneuver its body between
          the missile and the reactor(s).  Closing on impact would be
          too slow.  Evasion is useless.  Impact is weight in kg times
          the number of seconds this weapon spends in flight.  On a
          ship they take space appropriate for their weight.  They can
          have almost any form but are mostly cubes.  They are
          destroyed upon impact.  Most will simply cut through any
          ship like butter.  In rare cases, the missile might impact
          another ship, but rarely do they fly in such close
          proximity.  Missile may be triggered to explode instead of
          penetration.  In this case they trigger when they have given
          off a preset percentage of their penetration damage and
          explode for at most 10% of their weight in the cell they
          land in.
        </p>
        <p>
          <em>Example:</em> A missile of 270kg flies through space for
          20 seconds before it hits the Fortune, a 300T warship.  It
          generates 4000 points of impact damage and would rip through
          40 cells with the Fortune’s armour plating of 100 points.
          The Fortune only has 30 cells, but they are clustered
          3x3x3+3 in such a way that only 4 cells are penetrated.  The
          weapon material can be thought of as having a density of
          10kg/dm<sup>3</sup>, thus the hole through the ship would be
          30cm x 30cm.  Fortunately, this wasn’t the exploding type.
          Assuming it was, one cell would have seen an explosion for
          27kg / 20g = 1350 points.  Note that cells reduce impact
          inbound and outbound.  The explosion is also directed in all
          directions, so this means 200 points are reduced in 6
          directions before breaching neighboring cells.  On average,
          all 6 neighboring cells (assuming there are any) would take
          25 points of damage.  Any living being would be in serious
          trouble and computers or other delicate machinery is likely
          ruined.

          Random damage in Space through debris depends on speed and
          time.  Since speed depends on acceleration mostly, the
          following table assumes that you accelerate or decelerate at
          the constant rate.

          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>1g</td><td>1d</td><td>3d</td><td>10d</td>

          </tr>
        </table>
        <p>
          At different acceleration rates, the time needed to receive
          the appropriate damage is divided accordingly.  E.g. at 3g,
          it only takes 1 month at that speed to receive a strike of
          100 impact.  Alternatively, the modifier can be used.  This
          roll can be made routine by only considering one day at a
          time and roll an n5 every day (at 1g).  Debris that can
          cause damage to space stations on moons can be ignored.
          Since all debris and all “stationary” moons move on a
          regular course, collisions are automatically detected and
          usually taken care of ahead of time.  Weapons or intentional
          cloaking of such collisions are another matter.  See guided
          missiles.
