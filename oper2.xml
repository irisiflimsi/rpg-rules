        <h4>Page 1-6, 13-14, 17-18, 28-30</h4>
        <p>
          The attributes and descriptions remain in place as Harnworld
          requires them (at least for some characters).  In other
          words, without them, a character designed toward a specific
          career would be incomplete in the setting.  They are also
          not transformed in any way.  Generation of values can be
          used as suggested.  <em>Relationship and Loyalty</em> for
          contacts are descriptive only.
        </p>
        <p>
          Sunsigns are treated as direct modifiers, where they have
          a numeric value.
        </p>
        <h4>Page 7-8, 10</h4>
        <p>
          The attributes described are translated (linearly) into the
          range -15 to 15.  <em>Moraliy</em> is dropped.  Generation
          of values can be used as suggested.
        </p>
        <h4>Page 15</h4>
        <p>
          The occupations of the table on this page serve as skills
          and the listed "old" skills serve only as descriptive
          values.
        </p>
        <h4>Page 16, 19</h4>
        <p>
          <em>Automatic</em> skills are determined accoridng to the
          appropriate skill section (q.v.) and <em>Occupation</em>
          skills work as transformed for the previous page.  They open
          as 20 for the chosen occupation.  <em>Family</em> skills for
          parents in the same occupation add 2 points, while for a
          different occupation they add 5.  (This is effectively
          <em>Row-5-addition</em> of a 0 skill level.)
          <em>Optional</em> skills are as they exist, but new skills
          may be "invented"; the scope is at GM discretion.  Any
          reasoonable skill can be improved by 5 for each option point
          (OP) through <em>Row-5-addition</em>; this includes OPs
          gained for Veterans.  Militia skills are explained elsewhere
          as are psionics.
        </p>
        <h4>Page 20-22</h4>
        <p>
          Rules on these page are completely dropped currently.
          Generation of values can be used as suggested.
        </p>
        <h4>Page 23-27</h4>
        <p>
          Each clerical occupation is treated as a separate
          occupation, with the "old" skills being used in a
          descriptive sense.  The same is true for the Shek-Pvar.
          <em>Chantry Applications</em> are dropped.  Treat Sunsigns
          as direct modifiers from the <em>Convocational
          Sunsign Modifiers</em> for magic invocations.  Magic does
          not work along spell lines (q.v.).  Each military occupation
          is treated as a separate occupation as well.
        </p>
        <h4>Page 9, 11-12</h4>
        <p>
          Table results from these page are used purely in their
          descriptive sense.  Whether they retroractively have any
          effect on other attributes is a choice that can be made
          during character creation and according to the severity or
          interpretation of the result that you want to portait.
          <em>Piety</em> is turned into a skill (q.v.) for each deity.
          For a single deity the value can be chosen or generated as
          suggested.  All others are 0 initially.

          Sunsigns affect certain applications of skills.  Since the "old"
          skills still remain in their descriptive sense, a player
          should announce, when he feels like his sunsign would apply
          to a situation.  Sunsigns are direct modifiers.
        </p>
        <p>
          Available skills are according to the occupations listed,
          determined by Harnworld professions.  More skills may
          be created according to players' or GM's wishes. 
          Certain applications of skills are provided below with result
          tables to allow comparisons.

          All penalties described are available and will be used
          where they makes sense individually. They are applied to
          a skill level or attribute level as direct modifier an
          they are neither restricted to certain tests nor do they
          automatically apply to others.  The <em>encumbrance
          penalty</em> is calculated from the derived attribute of
          the same name, see the tables.

          Fatigue is recovered at a rate of 1 level per minute.

        <h4>Page 7</h4>
        <p>
          Learning is modelled by an active roll with level 0 against
          a passive level of the current skill. Note that rolling 10
          non-stop events can be shortened into rolling a 1 with a d10.
          Learning is applicable to attributes but the active roll is
          level -15.
        </p>
        <p>
          Such rolls may be made once a month in which the skill was
          used reasonably often. Usually only three such rolls apply.
          A teacher can also be combined with his own skill reduced by
          10 through <em>Row-5-addition</em>. This assumes that the
          teacher is available almost always during that time.
        </p>
        <p>
          Example: Suppose your skill is at 5 and your teacher has a
          skill of 12. According to the rules, we should first take the
          highest of the two parameters to be combined into a single
          skill roll, that is 0 and 2 (12 - 10).  Remember your active
          level is 0 in this situation.  Taking the difference of, we
          have a column index of 2 into the combination table and we
          read in the fifth row a 5, which will be added to 2 (the
          higher of the two numbers) to yield a 7. That is the active
          skill level to roll against your current skill level (5) to 
          improve.  We are pitting a 7 against a 5 with roughly a 70%
          chance of success and upon success the skill level is increased
          to 6.

        <p>
          Situations which require rolls are announced by the GM with
          a general description of what needs to be resolved.  Players
          will then argue, which skills could be applicable and the GM
          will give a corresponding percentage of how much they apply.
        </p>
        <p>
          For example, an assessment of the correct political relation
          between two rival noble families may be Herald/75% and
          Knight/50%, and Mercantyler/25%.
        </p>
        <p>
          Now roll for all applicable skills you have a value in.
          (Remember that a base 0 always applies.)  In the example
          above, the mercantyler has a 1 in 4 chance of using his
          mercantyler skill, say 12, and a 3 in 4 chance of using his
          knight skill 0.  All skills which were succeessfully rolled
          for are added up through <em>Row-3-addition</em> from the
          main rules .  The end result is the skill to roll
          against.

          Humans can accelerate and decelerate as 3 m/s each second.
          Turning options are in parts of a full circle (centered around
          the direction of travel).  E.g. at 3 m/s this means 60&#176;
          off the direction of travel on either side per second.  For the
          sake of playability variance in this should be suppressed,
          although a 20% spread (for a 10 level difference) with Agility
          modification could be appropriate.
        </p>
        <p>
          Horses accelerate and decelerate at 6 m/s each second but have
          the same turning options.

          Fatigue is acrued at the 10 points per minute (or 1 per second)
          for the generated maximum sprint speed. Fractions (which cannot
          exceed 1) of that speed generate the corresponding fractional
          fatigue rate. E.g. running at half the maximum speed gives 5 points
          per minute (or 1 per 12 seconds).  Only simple fractions are allowed.

          The listed weight can be lifted without dedicated tools.  At that point
          any activity is at -10.  This scales linearly down or up.  That means that
          any fraction of the weight carried also incurs the same fraction of
          -10 as penalty. Any multiple carried also gives the corresponding multiple
          as penalty.  Note that with certain penalties usually trivial activities
          (i.e. no roll required) become difficult, for instance not stumbling. 
        </p>
        <p>
          Still without tools, activity with both hands is impossible. Freeing one 
          hand incurs twice the penalty and assumes that the weight is liftable that
          way.

        <p>
          Armour is used as is, except the <em>Protection and Encumbrance</em> 
          part, wich is only descriptive. The bonus to an attack is a bonus of
          attacker's choice between all the relevant B/E/P values of his weapon.
          After the goal is reached, the corresponding defender B/E/P is deducted
          from the wound level.
        </p>
        <p>
          Defense is calculated as <em>Row-5-addition</em> of <em>Dodge</em> and
          <em>Block</em>.  Both are voluntary and may be subject to individual
          reductions. Missiles are dodged at half value.
        </p>
        <p>
          Missile range is interpreted as follows: at range 0, no penalties
          applies, at half short range -10 applies. At medium, short, extreme
          range listed the penalties -20, -40, -80 apply. Between those fixed values,
          apply linear interpolation.

          Mounted combat considers rider and mount to be one unit that have
          added their skills in the usual manner. The steed provides unarmed
          combat prowress. Unhorsing is dealt with as collateral damage to the
          rider/horse combination, which has a defense rating of the rider's
          skill.
        </p>
        <h3 id="com-1">Procedure</h3>
        <p>
          The following table is rolled for each combatant, adding any
          bonuses and subtracting any penalties.  The time is the number
          of seconds, which it takes to achieve the set <em>wound level</em>
          zero.  The <em>wound level</em> can be set higher, but then this
          number is subtracted. Estimated time and level can be played out
          against each other.  The intended <em>wound level</em> must be
          declared before the roll and in multiples of 5.  Once a (rolled)
          progression has reached its goal, a new skill roll is necessary.
        </p>
        <p>
          Any effects from wounds or other external influences in combat are
          applied immediately to pending progressions.  At the actors choice
          it can offset the goal or the time.  To prevent players from immediately
          aborting "bad" rolls, mandatory secret rolls by the GM can be used.
        </p>
        <p>
          If so desired, the intended wound level can be randomized in the usual
          way.  This can not be modified except through <em>control</em>.
          Alternatively, if time is fixed, a best effort attack can be made. For
          instance, if an opponent was downed and will get up within a few seconds
          and the bonus shall be used for better or worse.  In that case always
          spread the actual wound level around the least favorable time for the
          attacker.

        <p>
          Hit location is determined when the goal is reached.
          Before the goal is reached, a penalty of -1 can be taken
          to reduce the possible hit locations by one <em>Main</em>
          area. This penalty can be taken multiple times but the
          remaining main hit locations must be (bodily)
          connected. If all but one main location has been eliminated,
          individual percentage points may be reduced for a
          <em>Detail</em> area. This penalty can again be taken
          multiple times but the remaining detail hit locations 
          must be (bodily) connected.

        <p>
          Individual wounds are tracked numerically and with their
          location. Effects on the use of the corresponding part
          are described below. Minor effects are at 10 less than
          the original wound level and serious effects at 5 less.
        </p>
        <ul class="explain">
          <li>
            <b>1-5:</b> Minor.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>6-10:</b> Serious, serious use effect on neighbouring
            detailed body parts.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>11-15:</b> Grievous, the detailed body part cannot
            be used, serious use effects on neighbouring detailed
            body parts, and minor on main parts.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>16-20:</b> Incapacitating, the main body part cannot
            be used, minor use effects on neighbouring main body parts.
            (For head this means unconsciousness and for thorax imminent
            death.)
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>21+:</b>Destroyed, the main body part lost its integrity, 
            serious use effects on neighbouring main body parts. (For limbs
            this means at least severed. Thorax is split open or spinal 
            cord severed. For all but the extremities this means instant death.
            For all other body parts, death is probably imminent due to the
            side effects.)
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          A wound level 5 points above Dexterity on
          an arm causes any object held to be dropped (<em>Fumble</em>).  
          A wound level 5 points above Agility on a leg causes the victim
          to fall down (<em>Stumble</em>).  Technically, such rolls can 
          be made once a wound of any level is inflicted, but for
          playability, sticking with the average is recommended.
        </p>
        <p>
          Multiple attackers can combine their efforts through <em>Row-5-addition</em>
          into one.  This is generally a complex topic, because modifiers
          need to be accomodated as they enter the game, so this is best
          reserved for NPCs that perform as single units. Multiple defendants
          are similarly added; effectively a <em>Row-5-multipication</em>, since the same
          skill applies repeatedly.
        </p>
        <p>
          Hitting the wrong target can happen in melee and in missile combat.
          Usually this is ignored, but if this ignorance is taken into account
          when deciding on action options, such accidents shall be played out.
          Anybody within the (abstract) range of the weapon is subject to a
          level -5 attack.  This can be added to the benefit of other attackers
          as per multiple attacks above or resolved individually with the goal
          of 0 damage. Since missile attacks are resolved with indiviual shots,
          such an attack is applied only if the intended attack had no impact.
          (Note the different effect from collateral damage that is actually desired.)
        </p>
        <p>
          Weapon and armour damage is treated as collateral damage in the above 
          sense and usually ignored.  If required, WQ and the highest armour protective value
          is used as defense against such damage.  Human body quality is 0, but
          recall the armour layering effect; outer layers break first.
        </p>
        <p>
          Certain weapons can be used to entangle, including human arms and legs.
          Real damage from such attacks is 10 points less than what the actual result
          says.  The effects of the actual result cause the weapon
          itself to be disabled. Disentaglement takes a level 0 attack
          against the actual result by the victim. Others, including the
          attacker, may help or take advantage of the situation.
        </p>
        <p>
          Unarmed combat is usually not used to inflict much damage, but rather
          directed at making the opponent stumble, fumble, or unable to use a limb.
          A prone opponent is then easier to control. Unfortunately, this makes
          heavy use of the collateral damage and entangle rules and the
          stumble/fumble rules.
        </p>
        <p>
          With a total of 16+ injury points, a human passes out and is 
          incapacitated. This value can be randomized evyr time a wound
          is taken and is modified by Stamina through <em>Row-5-addition</em>.

          Any wound needs to heal its injury points. This is calculated
          via Stamina; certain medicine may improve the healing rate.
          A physician may make a skill roll to find or create the correct
          medicine but his skill is not added to the healing resolution
          directly.
        </p>
        <p>
          A serious wound may become infected (until it turns into a minor
          wound).  An infection is a daily attack on the wounded area with
          a level of the wound, defended against with Stamina. Medicine applies
          in the same way as for minor wounds, but it harder to obtain. A
          penalty of 5 is suitable. Any injury points gained through the
          infection is added to the original wound. This may turn the wound
          into a grievous wound.
        </p>
        <p>
          A grevious wound is a bleeder or otherwise makes the body lose
          vital fluids.  Bloodloss is treated as a separate injury, and
          increases at -10 per 10s. E.g., a 12 point injury causes 1 point
          of bloodloss to accrue every 5 seconds. Note that the circulatory
          system is incapacitated with 16 points as other body parts are.
          The circulatory system itself will not turn infectious. Treatment
          by physicians depend on the location. Some locations are incurable
          by Harnic physicians. For multiple bleeders only take the maximum
          in the same extremity, but add those for different extremities.
        </p>
        <p>
          Incapacitating and destroying wounds have no additional effects
          over the bleeder and infection dangers. (A 22 destroying wound
          causes more than 1 point per second in bloodloss and only very
          unlikely circumstances will keep the victim alive for more than
          15 seconds.)
        </p>
        <p>
          Amputations and immediate cauterizations stop infections.
