        <p>
          The attributes remain in place as
          Harnworld requires them. In other words, without them,
          a character is incomplete in the setting. They are also not
          transformed in any way. Generation of values can be used as
          suggested.
        </p>
        <h3 id="char-2">Pages 7-8, 10</h3>
        <p>
          The attributes described are translated (linearly) into
          the range -15 to 15. <em>Moraliy</em> is dropped.  Generation
          of values can be used as suggested.
        </p>
        <h3 id="char-3">Pages 9, 11-12</h3>
        <p>
          Table results from these page are used purely in their descriptive sense.
          Whether they retroractively have any effect on other attributes
          is a choice that can be made during character creation and according
          to the severity or interpretation of the result that you want to portait.
          <em>Piety</em> is turned into a skill (q.v.) for each deity. For a single
          deity the value can be chosen or generated as suggested. All others are 0
          initially.

          <li>
            <b>Level 0:</b> NN knows that the reigion exist but cannot
            separate it from other convocations.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Level 5:</b> Lip service payed to the religion and ability
            to separate it from other major faiths.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Level 10:</b> The main tenants of the religion are known
            and followed on individual level. Sects or heresies are not
            considered.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Level 15:</b> The religion is quoted often and other faiths
            routinely treated underhanded. Proselytizing is rarely attempted.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Level 20:</b> At this level the adherent is actively seeking
            to further the tenants of the religion outside of his immediate
            domain. Distinction between inner-religion minutiae are important.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Level 25:</b> Heresy is abhorred more than other religions.
            Support for the religion takes precendents over other interests
            almost always.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Level 30:</b> The adherent is a prophet for the religion and
            accepts otherwise serious consequences for following details of
            his faith. May invent rituals and the like.

        <p>
          The occupations of the table on this page serve as skills and the listed
          "old" skills serve only as descriptive values.
        </p>
        <h1 id="deter">Skill Determination</h1>
        <p>
          Available skills are listed below and are deteremined
          by Harnworld professions and some additional properties
          associated with the setting.  Situations which require 
          rolls are announced by the GM with a general description
          of what needs to be resolved.  Players will then argue,
          which skills could be applicable and the GM will
          give a corresponding percentage of how much they apply.
        </p>
        <p>
          For example, an assessemnt of the correct political relation
          between to rival noble families may be Herald/75% and
          Knight/50%, and Mercantyler/25%.
        </p>
        <p>
          Now roll for all applicable skills you have a value in.
          (Remember that a base 0 always applies.)  In the example
          above, the mercantyler has a 1 in 4 chance of using his
          mercantyler skill, say 12, and a 3 in 4 chance of using his knight 
          skill 0. All skills which were succeessfully rolled for are added up
          through row 3 from the main rules additions table (repeated here).
          The end result is the skill to roll against.
