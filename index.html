      <h1>Motivation</h1>
      <p>
        Almost all rules that are (or were) available on the market suffer from the
        same flaw. When simulating a specific game world or setting,
        rules are created that lend themselves to certain usage that is
        often called <em>abuse</em>, <em>rule lawyerism</em>, or
        associated with <em>simulationism</em>.  This usage is in
        accordance with the rules and while sometimes not intended, it is
        taken into account - which is why most rules have a <em>GM
        fiat</em> as a last resort, when valid rule interpretations
        disrupt the game. This should not be the case. Rules that are
        ignored or changed in the course of the game change the game. If
        that is intentional, then rules that are intended to be overruled
        should not stated as rules in the first place.
      </p>
      <p>
        Some other rule sets aim more at fostering creativity and have little or no
        rules to accomodate reality, because reality is either assumed
        self-evident or is bent according to the <em>rule of cool</em> or
        simliar gimmick.  But an RPG is not a script, or at least
        should not be or feel like it. When there are rules to deal with reality 
        exist, they suffer from the flaws stated above or are ambiguous enough 
        not to be called <em>rules</em>.
      </p>
      <p>
        The rules presented below aim to achieve both simplicity, as to
        prevent complex rule interpretations disrupting a game, and
        completeness, as to allow arbitrary situations in
        <em>reality</em> to be judged. The rules are only concerned with
        applicability to the game world. Rules for adding
        <em>hero</em> qualities, <em>coolness</em> or plot twists can easily be
        added.
      </p>
      <h3 id="scale">Scalability</h3>
      <p>
        One of the technical flaws of almost every single set of rules I
        have come across is the scalibility of skills and difficulties.
        With this rule set, higher skill levels compare to higher
        difficulty level exactly as lower skills and lower difficulty
        level. At every <em>level</em> the rules yield the same
        probability.
      </p>
      <p>
        One consequence of this is that applying rules across multiple actors or
        multiple targets happens (<em>scales</em>) smoothly, there are no odd jumps in
        probabilities or a new type of rule that needs to be applied.
        Thus separate rules that apply to <em>higher scale</em>
        situations are not necessary
      </p>
      <h3 id="dim">Dimensions</h3>
      <p>
        Many rules complicate situations, especially combat, because they address the 
        complexity of tactical decisions by creating artificial dimensions. Strength,
        Combat skills and Hit points are the dominating techical terms. This unnecessary
        creation of dimensions will be avoided. Tactical decisions should only be
        applied to one dimension, which is directly related to the <em>skill</em> rule
        used. This is done in the hope that both simplicity and <em>realism</em> can be
        fostered at the same time.
      </p>
      <h3 id="term">Terminology</h3>
      <p>
        One final note regarding terminology. As can be seen, we are already using
        terminology in the motivational section of this rule set. Such terms usually require 
        definitions or a background in the subject matter. But even then, terminology can
        be debated. In order not to increase this exposition to more philosophical lengths,
        let me just say that you need to read through this, in order to understand meaning
        of usage of many such terms. There is no definition section.
