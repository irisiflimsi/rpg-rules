      <h1>Motivation</h1>
      <p>
        At first I was tempted to start a philosophical debate about RPG
        rules in general and a justification of my attempt
        specifically. But this would soon turn out to take up more space
        than the entire rules to be presented. So this discussion must be
        provided elsewhere.  Suffice it to say that my disinfatuation
        with current rules available stems from the fact that they are
        overly complicated for the little "fitness" they show for
        representing the genre or game world they supposedly apply to.
      </p>
      <p>
        Two major issues that annoy in particular I want to address
        shortly in the next two section.
      </p>
      <h3 id="scale">Scalability</h3>
      <p>
        One of the technical flaws of almost every single set of rules I
        have come across is the applicability of skills and difficulties
        as they progress.  With this rule set, higher skill levels
        compare to higher difficulty level exactly as lower skills and
        lower difficulty level. At every <em>level</em> the rules yield
        the same probability.
      </p>
      <p>
        One consequence of this, as it turns out, is that using rules for
        multiple actors or multiple targets happens (<em>scales</em>)
        smoothly. There are no odd jumps in probabilities when rules are
        applied to groups nor is there a need for a new type of rule.
        Thus separate rules that apply to massive or complex (<em>large
        scale</em>) situations are not necessary.
      </p>
      <h3 id="dim">Dimensions</h3>
      <p>
        Many rule sets complicate situations, especially combat, because
        they address the complexity of tactical decisions by creating
        artificial dimensions. Strength, Combat skills and Hit points are
        the dominating techical terms. This unnecessary creation of
        dimensions should be avoided. Tactical decisions should only be
        applied to comprehensive dimensions, which directly relate to
        the <em>reality</em> modelled. This is done here in the hope
        that both simplicity and <em>realism</em> can be fostered at the
        same time.
      </p>

      <h1>Basic Rule</h1>
      <p>
        You roll a <em>d5</em> until you roll a <em>1</em> and the count
        the number of dice that did not show up a <em>1</em>. That is the
        same as the number of dice you actually rolled minus one. The
        higher you get, the better, therefore we call it the
        <em>positive</em> roll. This roll is dominated by the active
        character, or more generally, the actor. Of course, there is a
        <em>negative</em> roll that is associated with the passive
        resistance or impediment, which is handled in the same way. These
        two numbers are subtracted. The result will be a whole
        number (i.e. a positive or negative number without fractional
        part). An understanding of this rule is crucial, so we elaborate a
        bit by listing the probabilities involved as well as some
        examples.
