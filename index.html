      <h1>Motivation</h1>
      <p>
        Almost all rules that are available on the market suffer from the
        same flaw. When simulating a specific game world or setting,
        rules are created that lend themselves to certain usage that are
        often called <em>abuse</em>, <em>rule lawyerism</em>, or
        associated with <em>simulationism</em>.  This usage is in
        accordance with the rules and while sometimes not intended, it is
        taken into account - which is why most rules have a <em>GM
        fiat</em> as a last resort, when valid rule interpretations
        disrupt the game. This should noz be the case. Rules that are
        ignored or changed in the course of the game change the game. If
        that is intentional, then rules that are intended to be overruled
        should not stated as rules in the first place.
      </p>
      <p>
        Some other rule sets aim more at fostering creativity and have no
        rules to accomodate reality, because reality is either assumed
        self-evident or is bent according to the <em>rule of cool</em> or
        simliar gimmick.  But an RPG game is not a script, or at least
        should not be or feel like it.
      </p>
      <p>
        The rules presented below aim to achieve both simplicity, as to
        prevent complex rule interpretation disrupting a game, and
        completeness, as to allow arbitrary situations in
        <em>reality</em> to be judged. The rules are only concerned with
        applicability to the game world. But rules for adding
        <em>hero</em> qualities or plot twists can easily be added.
      </p>
      <h3><a href="scale">Scalability</a></h3>
      <p>
        One of the technical flaws of almost every single set of rules I
        have come across is the scalibility of skills and difficulties.
        With this rule set, higher skill levels compare to higher
        difficulty level exactly as lower skills and lower difficulty
        level. At every <em>level</em> the rules yield the same
        probability.
      </p>
      <p>
        One consequence of this is that scaling across multiple actors or
        multiple targets scale smoothly, there are no odd jumps in
        probabilities or a new type of rule that needs to be applied.
