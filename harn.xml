        <p>
          This is a set of rules, which represent the aspects dealt
          with in the HM3 rule book.  It is difficult to distinguish
          between in-world and out-world rules in HM3 as published.
          Since our aim is to simplify, we will not rewrite all rules
          accordingly, but rather rather stay with the rules as
          written.  When appropriate we mention the distinction
          between in- and out-world.
        </p>
        <h4>Justification</h4>
        <p>
          Sometimes people ask, why rewrite the rules, if the way that
          they adjucate situations changes only slightly and this only
          adds another layer of complexity.  In fact, we add a layer
          of simplification.  The benefit of better scaling and other
          issues that are better addressed warrant the effort.  The
          previous versions of the rules, however, clouded that,
          because we attempted to rewrite them so as to look
          <em>original</em>.  This is no longer attempted, but we only
          explain how these met-rules are applied.
        </p>
        <h4>Probabilities</h4>
        <p>
          This describes the main out-world rule.  A new type of roll
          is introduced, the stop roll.  You roll a d5 until you get a
          1 and then count the number of dice that did not show up a
          1.  That is the same as the number of dice you actually
          rolled minus one.  This roll is made by the active
          character, or more generally, the actor.  It will generate
          positive numbers (or zero) and is termed the
          <em>positive</em> roll and abbreviated as <em>p5</em>.
          Example: Peter rolls 5, 3, 8, 10, 2 (in that order) on a
          d10.  He simulates the d5 by taking the result of a d10,
          halving it and rounding up.  He thus rolled 3, 2, 4, 5, 1,
          on a d5 effectively.  His p5 roll would be a 4.
        </p>
        <p>
          Of course, there is a <em>negative</em> roll that is
          associated with the passive resistance or the impediment.
          It is handled in the same way but the negative value is
          taken instead.  Thus in the above example, we would take -4
          as result of a negative roll; therefore we can simply denote
          the roll as -p5.  These two numbers (from different rolls)
          are added.  The result will be a whole number, called
          <em>n5</em> (n for neutral).  More examples are provided in
          the generic ruleset.  We only repeat the main table for
          convenience.
        </p>
        <include id="$Basic"/>
        <p>
          The general rules also talk about adding skills.  We repeat
          the table provided in that ruleset and also have an
          automated formula here (Html only) when more precise values
          are requested.

        <p>
          When using the tables, take the two numbers and use the
          (positive) difference of the two in the first row, to read
          off a result in the second, and add this result to the
          bigger to get the end result.  Looking at the tables, you
          see the reduction in effectiveness when adding smaller
          numbers to higher ones.  Sometimes, to ease writing, we
          denote addition of skill (or task) numbers with
          +<sub>5</sub>, e.g. <em>1 +<sub>5</sub> 2</em>.  This is
          called 5-Addition, because <em>0 +<sub>5</sub> 0 = 5</em>.
        </p>

        <h3 id="s3kills">Overview</h3>
        <p>
          Analyzing the probabilities, we have about four distinct
          levels as described in the main page.  Interestingly, any
          competence in H&#226;rnworld is abstracted on a five-star
          scale &#9733; through &#9733;&#9733;&#9733;&#9733;&#9733;,
          where exceptional values may go beyond.  Whenever we have
          ML, SB or other technical terms, we append an U to
          distinguish the Universal rules, from the classic. E.g. MLU
          and SBU.  You can calculate MLU as ML * 0.4.  The basic
          50/50 chance of success on a skill roll is with an ML of
          50%, i.e. an MLU of 20. Thus the most basic task difficulty
          - all other things being equal - should be set to 20.
        </p>
        <p>
          Skills govern all activities, from combat to spell-casting.
          All skills are rated on an open scale starting from zero
          (0), with only 10% reaching 10 points more.  This general
          situation is in-world knowledge and what the star-rating is
          used for.  But this is also identical with the p5 system of
          rolling dice, which is out-world.  The skill scale is
          open-ended as the p5 roll is, but humans generally do not
          get scores beyond 50 (out-world) or
          &#9733;&#9733;&#9733;&#9733;&#9733; (in-world).  A skill
          level is often called ML.  Each &#9733; is equivalent to 10
          points of MLU.
        </p>
        <p>
          The following is a list of skills that are commonly used by
          people on H&#226;rn.  It is neither complete no without
          overlap.  It is an in-world collection of relevance.

        <h4>Skill Development</h4>
        <p>
          Skill Development is set up such that about 20% of MLU of n
          have MLU+10.  Since everyone has at least MLU 0, for normal
          cases, this means that about 3 in 10000 have MLU of 50.
          Individual may be awarded by the GM at any time, when
          something was &#8220;learned&#8221; (this is out-world).
          Remember that you learn most from failures.  Some skills may
          be developed by practice/study, some require training.  When
          you need time to learn, read this from the following table.
          I.e. the better you already are, the harder it is to
          improve.
        </p>
        <include id="$Teaching"/>
        <p>
	  Some skill require that a teacher is present at the
	  beginning of a skill career, e.g. because a Lnaguags cannot
	  be learned without someone who actually speaks it reasonably
	  well, or &#8220;glass blower trade secret&#8221; are
	  imparted.  This is mentioned with the approproate skill.
	</p>
	<p>
	  In all cases, GM discretion is highly advosed.  when a
	  mentor, coach, or teacher is available it can improve
	  learning speed.  But materials may be of bad quality or
	  study time is interrupted frequently.  The time to increase
	  an MLU this way should usually be within 20% of the listed
	  number. (A more thorough rule can be devised, but this does
	  not seem to be of general interest.
        </p>
        <p>
          Sometimes forgetting or &#8220;unlearning&#8221; is called
          for.  If skill has not been used for as many days is stated
          in the table to <em>learn</em> something, deduct a point.
        </p>
        <p>
          Improving Specialties is a bit more elaborate.  Skills list
          specialties with a percentage value.  This percentage value
          gives the approximate part of the whole group that this
          specialization comprises.  When the skill is improved (the
          skill group of all specialties) all improvement may be
          dedicated to the specialty instead.  As an example, a
          Specialty/20 could see an improvement of 5 points instead of
          a 1 for the group and a 40% Specialty an improvement of 2.5
          points of the specialty instead of 1 for the group.  So,
          divide 100% by the given percentage to get a multiple
          <em>m</em>.  The time needed is the average of all the MLU
          points improved according to the basic law.
        </p>
        <p>
          Note: If at any time the skill group itself is developed,
          specialties are only improved, if they would fall below the
          MLU of the group otherwise.  It would be prudent to learn
          the &#8220;opposite&#8221; Specialty.
        </p>
        <h4>Dimensions</h4>
        <p>
          Dimensions are collected as common reference for the many
          skills that use them in more or less the same manner.
        </p>
        <p>
          The <em>Divine Grace ratio</em> (Piety : Ritual) is
          multiplied to cleric miracle results that effect the caster
          alone in a beneficial way.  Healing, etc.  Note that this
          ratio will usually not exceed 1.5, because rituals are
          tenants of a religion.
        </p>
        <p>
          Dimensions are common grading systems that apply to multiple
          skills.  They determine a frame of reference for the
          difficulties of tasks.  They can also used in-world, but are
          more regularly used out-world, when a PC tries to achieve a
          concrete goal.
        </p>
        <h4>Attributes</h4>
        <p>
          Attributes come in textual form and a few in numeric form.
          The numeric attributes are listed above separately.  To have
          an appropriate scale, and keep the rule, just keep the
          attribute as-is.  Everything else, including the star-scale
          follows from there.
        </p>
        <p>
	  When an attribute roll is called for, it comes in two forms.
	  The first treats the attribute as a ficticious skill with an
	  ML as a multiple of the attribute.  This form is treated as
	  any MLU.  Say, Strength is 9 and a roll vs. 2 x Strength is
	  called for.  The MLU is 7 and the task level is 20
	  (default).
        </p>
        <p>
	  The second version is rolling n number of d6, summing them
	  up and stay below an attribute value.  This does not fit
	  well into the scheme, but the spirit is obviously that with
	  each additional die the chances to succeed become sharply
	  worse.  Treat 1d6 as task level 0, 2d6 as task level 5, 3d6
	  as 10, and so on.
        </p>
        <h4>Specialties</h4>
        <p>
          Many skills can be divided into sub-skills or specialties;
          suggestions are given with some skills.  Characters may
          select specialties at any time.  The skill is then termed a
          group skill and includes all (potential) specialties, even
          if unknown.  The specific specialty skill is opened at the
          current group MLU (note that the ML can be calculated from
          that, if needed).  Each specialty is developed as a separate
          skill.
        </p>
        <p>
          Sometimes, only Specialties are given and the question
          arises, what MLU in the Specialty applies to the skill
          group.  Each specialty has a percentage value associated
          with it.  (For a new Specialty, this must be decided upon by
          the GM.)  Take that percentage of Specialty MLU to get the
          group&#8217;s MLU.  For example, a Mask/20% specialty in
          Woodcraft of 12 would imply a Woodcraft group score of 2.4,
          rounded down to 2.  This applies only to MLU.  OML (if
          specialization is attempted at the outset) is as for the
          group skill.
        </p>
        <h4>Sunsign</h4>
        <p>
          Sunsigns represent an astrological affinity to certain
          skills in-world, see below.  They give a direct bonus to the
          MLU.
        </p>
        <h4>Skill Testing</h4>
        <p>
          MLU is modified for a concrete test due to various
          circumstance resulting in an EMLU. Only minor additions or
          subtractions are considered.  In the odd case, where
          original rules call for taking half of the ML, subtract 10
          from the MLU.
        </p>
        <p>
          When a character attempts to use a skill, n5 is rolled,
          adding EMLU.  The GM will have decided upon a diffculty
          level of the task, often called the <em>negative</em> part.
          Some modfifiers are compounded here, although this makes no
          difference, whether it were included in the EMLU instead.
          This value is also subtracted from the roll and if the net
          result is non-negative, the skill has been successfully
          employed; if the roll is negative, the attempt has failed.
          For example, if a PC declares the intent to perform a
          gymnastic feat, the GM would instruct the player to
          &#8220;test Acrobatics against difficulty 15.&#8221; In
          cases where success or failure may not be obvious, the GM
          should make the roll secretly.
        </p>
        <p>
          It is often necessary to know the degree of success or
          failure.  The skill descriptions provide these so-called
          dimensions.  For skills, where no appropriate success levels
          are provided or for newly devised skills, estimate the
          effects by looking at the skills most closely related.
        </p>
        <p>
          When two characters use skills against each other, each
          character makes a p5 skill roll appropriate to the skill in
          question and the results are compared to give a net result.
          The descriptions of the two skills should match this net
          result (they should obviously be the negative of each
          other).  The character with the higher result wins the
          challenge.  If both characters achieve the same success
          level, the stalemate result of zero (0) applies.  If a tie
          is not appropriate to the situation, then decimal place may
          be rolled as explained in the initial section.
        </p>
        <h4>Penalties</h4>
        <p>
          Penalties are added to the task difficulty and rated at 40%
          of the original value.  For instance, a S10 wound turns into
          a -4 IPU.
	</p>
        <h4>Special Skill Considerations</h4>
        <p>
          Situations or skill applications can either fit to a certain
          skill fully or only partially.  Sometimes multiple skills
          may apply.  In any given situation, the GM will state the
          skills that apply and to what percentage.  Then use a
          weighted average as skill.  Example: The GM rules that
          performing a ballet, is 60% Acrobatics and 40% Dancing
          non-overlapping.  A character with MLU Acrobatics/16 and MLU
          Dancing/11 has MLU Ballet/14.
        </p>
        <p>
          Multiple attackers can combine their efforts through
          5-Addition into one.  This is generally a complex topic,
          because modifiers need to be accommodated as they enter the
          game, so this is best reserved for NPCs that perform as
          single units.  Multiple defendants are similarly added.  An
          exception to this is mounted combat, where PC rider and
          horse may be acting in unison.
        </p>
        <h3 id="d3im">Dimensionality</h3>
        <p>
          Some pre-determined skills, dimensions, and attributes,
          including important aspects for character generation, are
          listed here.  When several listed occupations apply, use the
          5-Addition of the result.  This does not apply to the
          Languages, Scripts and Musician skill group, where each time
          an occupation is mentioned, it may (and usually will)
          indicate a separate skill.  Specialties are also treated
          this way: as separate opening.
        </p>
        <p>
          As a convenience, a list of the used percentage to OML is
          provided (rounded).

        <include id="$Skilllist"/>
        <h5 id="di-acc">Accuracy</h5>
        <p>
          Judging the values of goods produced or performances
          delivered works the same for almost all skills.  This is
          different from the commercial value, which depends on a lot
          of other factors (market size, etc).  The rare occasion,
          where an ML of the actor cannot be judged are at GM
          discretion.  I.e. someone who successfully evades perception
          cannot be judged on this &#8220;performance&#8221; by the
          potentially fooled or only in the most general sense.  The
          value in parenthesis is the range by which the estimation
          may be off.  It is calculated from the percentage value x by
          the range (100% - x) to 1/(100% - x).

        <include id="$Acrobatics"/>
        <p>
          Acrobatics Skill is tested when a character attempts a
          gymnastic feat that is more than a simple matter of native
          Agility.  These include vaults, somersaults, back-flips,
          twisting in mid-air to land on one&#8217;s feet, etc.

        <include id="$D-Acrobatics"/>
        <h5 class="skill" id="sk-act">Acting</h5>
        <include id="$Acting"/>
        <p>
          The ability to play a role.  Used to determine the success
          of a masquerade or dramatic performance.  Acting includes
          the ability to disguise oneself and/or to assume a false
          identity.  This may imply possession of a repertoire of
          theatrical roles and character portrayals appropriate to
          culture.
        </p>
        <include id="$D-Acting"/>
        <h5 class="skill" id="sk-agi">Agility</h5>
        <include id="$Agility"/>
        <p>
          The skill is used for multiple purposes; to avoid falling
          objects, weapon and missile attacks, and other situations
          requiring Agility.
        </p>
        <h5 class="skill" id="sk-agr">Agriculture</h5>
        <include id="$Agriculture"/>
        <p>
          The ability to grow crops.  It determines the
          quality/quantity of crops produced.  Results depend on land
          quality, weather, etc.  Agriculture is also crop management
          ability, useful for running a farm or fief.  Yield is the
          crop yield per year, i.e. this roll applies once per year.
          Different crops may be specialties.  Use the <em>Yield</em>
          dimension.
        </p>
        <h5 class="skill" id="sk-alc">Alchemy</h5>
        <include id="$Alchemy"/>
        <p>
          Used for the analysis and/or production of chemical or
          alchemical compounds.  Alchemists devise (or otherwise
          acquire) recipes for their craft.  Use of this skill
          requires access to the necessary equipment, texts, and
          materials.  Use the <em>Recipe</em> dimension for NPCs.
        </p>
        <h5 class="skill" id="sk-ani">Animalcraft</h5>
        <include id="$Animalcraft"/>
        <p>
          The ability to domesticate, breed, and train animals.
          Animalcraft also includes basic veterinary medicine.  Test
          Animalcraft when breaking or domesticating animals, and for
          each trick/task to be taught.  The time required for various
          efforts is at GM discretion.  More willful and older animals
          are harder to train, and few animals tolerate more than two
          hours training daily.  Each species of animal can be a
          Specialty.  Use the <em>Recipe</em> dimension for NPCs that
          may surround themselves with trained animals.  Intelligence
          in the table means the attribute of the animal to be
          trained.  If the animal isn&#8217;t smart enough, nothing is
          learned.  Also use the <em>Yield</em> dimension four times
          for each reasonable trick.  Tricks must be practiced to be
          retained by the animal.
        </p>
        <include id="$D-Animalcraft"/>
        <h5 class="skill" id="sk-ast">Astrology</h5>
        <include id="$Astrology"/>
        <p>
          The ability to chart the stars, cast horoscopes, and make
          predictions based on astrological knowledge.  Astrology
          includes knowledge of astronomy.  The art of using astrology
          to make predictions is called Astromancy; it may serve as an
          oracle or divination skill.  PCs may find it beneficial to
          visit an astromancer to learn the portents before
          undertaking a major adventure.  Such efforts take several
          hours, at least, to prepare.  The dimensions to use are
          <em>Accuracy</em> (of the prediction).
        </p>
        <h5 class="skill" id="sk-aur">Aura</h5>
        <p>
          Attribute in the range as described.  Only used as direct
          bonus for skills except for NPCs.
        </p>
        <h5 class="skill" id="sk-awa">Awareness</h5>
        <include id="$Awareness"/>
        <p>
          Subliminal sensitivity to the environment.  Awareness may be
          tested when a character says something like, &#8220;I look
          around.&#8221; It also is tested if an event occurs and the
          GM wishes to determine who might have noticed it, or at
          least have noticed that something is out of place.
          Awareness rolls are often made secretly by the GM.  Sleeping
          5-adds at least 20 to any Awareness difficulty.  Loud noises
          give a bonus to the Skill roll.
        </p>
        <h5 class="skill" id="sk-axe">Axe</h5>
        <include id="$Axe"/>
        <p>
          The ability to use hafted, edged weapons.  Specialties
          include Battleaxe, Handaxe, Hatchet, Shorkana (throwing
          axe), Sickle (peasant weapon), and Warhammer.  Poleaxes are
          treated as Polearms (a separate skill).  Use the
          <em>Combat</em> dimensions.
        </p>
        <h5 class="skill" id="sk-blo">Blowgun</h5>
        <include id="$Blowgun"/>
        <p>
          A rare skill except among the Lia-Kavair, clergy of Naveh,
          and certain tribes in tropical and equatorial rain-forests.
          No specialties exist.  Use the <em>Combat</em> dimensions.
        </p>
        <h5 class="skill" id="sk-bow">Bow</h5>
        <include id="$Bow"/>
        <p>
          The ability to use bows.  Specialties include Crossbow,
          Hartbow (elven composite bow), Longbow, and Shortbow.
          Crossbows: The use of crossbows is not widespread in western
          Lythia.  They are forbidden for military use by canon and
          secular law in all civilized realms, and carrying one may
          draw suspicion and harassment.  Nevertheless, crossbows are
          employed by the Khuzdul, and some brigands.  Only light
          (hand-pulled) crossbows exist.  Use the <em>Combat</em>
          dimensions.
        </p>
        <h5 class="skill" id="sk-bre">Brewing</h5>
        <include id="$Brewing"/>
        <p>
          Different beverage types may be specialties.  The ability to
          prepare alcoholic and other beverages.  Used to determine
          the quality of brewed ale, beer, cider, etc.  Basic
          materials are necessary.  Depending on cultural background,
          this may include the ability to make wines and spirits.
          Brewing for public consumption is closely controlled by the
          Innkeepers Guild, although it is legal to brew for personal
          use.  Ales do not travel well and most inns produce their
          own brews.  Brewing uses the <em>Recipes</em> domain.
        </p>
        <h5 class="skill" id="sk-cer">Ceramics</h5>
        <include id="$Ceramics"/>
        <p>
          Determines the quality of pottery items produced.  Results
          are limited by the quality of materials and equipment.
          Brewing uses the <em>Recipes</em> domain.
        </p>
        <h5 class="skill" id="sk-cli">Climbing</h5>
        <include id="$Climbing"/>
        <p>
          Tested when a character attempts to climb an obstacle.  The
          GM assesses a climb by the dimensions in the table.
          Additional modifiers should be made for slipperiness and
          availability of holds.  If the character has climbing gear
          (rope and grappling hook or spikes and mallet) and can use
          them, increase EML.  Speed is measured in feet per second.
          A running total of vertical progress is kept to determine
          when the climb is complete, and the extent of any fall.  A
          single scale should only be rolled once, but any
          interruption, such as rest requires a new roll.  Any
          negative speed result (below -5) implies a fall.  Climbing
          speed can be increased at the price of increasing the risk.
          For each 5 levels of speed that are accepted as fall,
          increase ML by 1 point.  A fall is evenly distributed across
          the attempted climbing height.
        </p>
        <include id="$D-Climbing"/>
        <h5 class="skill" id="sk-clu">Club</h5>
        <include id="$Club"/>
        <p>
          The ability to use hafted, clubbing weapons.  Specialties
          include Club, Mace, Maul, and Morningstar.  Because club
          weapons are omni-directional, they are easier to master than
          axes.  Use the <em>Combat</em> dimensions.
        </p>
        <h5 id="di-com">Combat</h5>
        <p>
          One dimension is the time (in seconds), which it takes to
          achieve the wound level zero on the defender.  The wound
          level is a separate dimension.  You should use trajectories.
          Once a (rolled) progression has reached its goal, a new
          skill roll is necessary.  It is therefore possible to play
          10 second round-based combat.
        </p>
        <p>
          Any effects from wounds or other external influences in
          combat are applied immediately to pending progressions, but
          the wound itself is modified by <em>B/E/P</em> of choice and
          the appropriate armor.  The offset is alonge the trajecory
          chosen.  Note that the same is true for affects on the
          defender.  If this implies an action to occur in the past,
          it is resolved immediately.
        </p>
        <p>
          If time is fixed, a best effort attack can be made.  For
          instance, if an opponent was downed and will get up within a
          few seconds and the bonus shall be used for better or worse.
          Since combat is a often used routine, the tables is more
          extensive than usual.
        </p>
        <include id="$D-Combat"/>
        <p>
          If a round based system is preferred, all must adhere to it.
          This is often difficult to do right, but must be weighed
          against the number crunching efforts needed for the
          full-dimensions approach.  If rounds are used, they abstract
          a number of seconds to a round, like 6 or 10.  Here, we
          supply the modifiers for fighting in 10 second rounds.  Note
          that the same scheme must be applied to all participants
          (actors) in the scene but the modifiers vary, if an action
          has a time dimension (measured in seconds).  A sensible
          modifier often is the value that most closely rounds to the
          number of rounds the activity is performed in.  The
          following table does this for the Combat Time dimension.
          Note that the more time an action takes, that could have
          been achieved within a round, the higher the bonus.

        <p>
          Cultural, regional, or even religious specialties are
          possible.  Determines the appeal and nutritional value of
          meals.  Failure by 5 results in poorly-prepared and/or
          bad-tasting food.  Failure by 10 may cause food poisoning.
          Use the <em>Recipes</em> domain.

        <h5 class="skill" id="sk-dag">Dagger</h5>
        <include id="$Dagger"/>
        <p>
          The ability to use short-bladed weapons, mostly as secondary
          weapons.  Specialties include Keltan (main gauche), Knife,
          and Taburi (throwing knife).  Use the <em>Combat</em>
          dimensions.
        </p>
        <h5 class="skill" id="sk-dan">Dancing</h5>
        <include id="$Dancing"/>
        <p>
          The ability to perform various types of dance.  Specialties
          such as folk or erotic dancing are viable.  Dancing is very
          important in some cultures, and can be used to enhance
          spellcasting (see H&#226;rnMaster Magic).  Dances are social
          interactions.  Without at least visible encounters with
          dances, OML is -10.  Use the <em>Artistic</em> dimension.
        </p>
        <h5 class="skill" id="sk-dex">Dexterity</h5>
        <include id="$Dexterity"/>
        <p>
          Legerdemain (Sleight of hand) is tested when a character
          attempts to perform a feat of manual dexterity without being
          detected by observers or victims.  Examples include cutting
          a victim&#8217;s money-purse from behind or moving shells in
          a shell game.  The victim oppose with Awareness to detect
          the attempt.  If the victim is not paying attention,
          penalties apply.  If the result is negative the legerdemain
          is detected.  Awareness rolls may also be made for any
          potential witnesses.  Shells or a coin are assumed for the
          listed penalty.  The Grope dimension is the time a trick
          takes, but mostly for larger objects - this is a combat
          dimension.

        <p>
          The ability to produce a likeness, or to assess the artistic
          quality or realism of a drawing or painting.  Different
          styles and media (such as painting, fresco, pen and ink,
          woodcut, etc.) may be considered specialties.  Cartography
          is a specialty of Drawing used to produce poetic maps.  The
          quality of a map is limited by the information available to
          its maker.  Poetic maps are more often judged by the
          attractiveness of the cherubs in the margins than by their
          accuracy.  Characters with Drawing skill may be allowed to
          copy their memory maps in poetic style to sell or show to
          other PCs.  Use the <em>Artistic</em> dimension.

        <h5 class="skill" id="sk-emb">Embalming</h5>
        <include id="$Embalming"/>
        <p>
          Determines success when embalming a corpse against
          deterioration, and when preparing a corpse for
          burial/cremation.  The skill also includes familiarity with
          local rituals; since journeymen embalmers need to travel
          widely, this can result in quite an accumulation of
          knowledge.  Religious and/or cultural differences may be
          treated as specialties.  Civilized cultures take great care
          with their dead - embalming is a sign of respect and honor,
          and has serious emotional and religious overtones.  Most
          temples use master embalmers (either bonded or free) to
          oversee their burial rituals.  Embalming includes limited
          knowledge of practical Alchemy and Perfumery.  Embalmers
          know how to make incense and soap, for example.

          Read Endurance as Healingrate for Fatigue, see Stamina.
          Remember that the fatigue accrued must be used as modifier
          for the next time interval. Standard healing rate is one
          level per minute.  Also consider the increased fatigue rate
          for carrying heavy loads.

        <p>
          Different techniques may be treated as specialties: Hook and
          Line, Spear-fishing, Net-fishing, etc.  Some characters may
          want to fish with their bare hands.  Conditions are assessed
          by the GM depending on season, locale, and equipment.  Fish
          alone does not provide a balanced diet.  With otherwise
          average condition the base yield is 1 manday worth of fish.
          Conditions range from excellent +20 to poor -20.  (Of
          course, fishing requires a sufficiently large body of water,
          capable of sustaining fish.  Overfishing may imply
          additional penalties.)  Fishing uses the <em>Yield</em> and
          <em>(Yield) Time</em> dimensions.

        <include id="$Fletching"/>
        <p>
          The ability to make and repair bows and arrows.  Base yield
          is 1/4 bow or 3 arrows, which assumes tools and materials
          are readily available and a 12 hour period of work per day.
          Use the <em>Yield</em> and <em>Yield (Time)</em> dimensions.
        </p>
        <h5 class="skill" id="sk-fol">Folklore</h5>
        <include id="$Folklore"/>
        <p>
          Different cultural types may be specialties.  Knowledge of
          myths, legends, and history.  This is an oral tradition in
          most cultures.  Successful use of the skill means the
          character remembers information relevant to the subject
          being inquired about.  To avoid rolling multiple times on
          the table, the PC that searches his arsenal should give a
          trajectory among the two dimensions, after the GM tells him
          how obscure the sought story actually is.  For example,
          Rogan is attempting to recall the name of a great hero of
          some common legend.  50% go to depth and 50% to breadth.
          Rolling a result of 0 would imply that 30% of great myths
          can be repeated and the GM rules that the hero&#8217;s name
          belongs to the important part of the myth.  Thus Rogan
          recalls the name: Genin.  Use the <em>Knowledge</em>
          dimension.

        <p>
          Different climate and terrain types may be specialties.
          Finding (vegetarian) food in the wilderness.  Tested when a
          character looks for edible plants, etc.  The GM assesses
          conditions depending on season and locale, and uses the
          table to determine the mandays of food found.  Areas near
          civilization are likely to have a penalty of 10-20.
          Excellent conditions exist only in tropical rain-forests and
          special places like the Shava Forest with 10 bonus.  Season
          is highly relevant.  To seek specific plants, see Herblore.
          For hunting meat, see Tracking.  Use the <em>Yield</em> and
          <em>(Yield) Time</em> dimensions.

        <h5 class="skill" id="sk-gla">Glasswork</h5>
        <include id="$Glasswork"/>
        <p>
          The ability to produce glassware.  Appropriate tools and
          materials are necessary.  Most people believe glassworkers
          use magic to create their wares.  Glass is used for
          tableware, objects d&#8217;art, alchemical equipment, and,
          occasionally, for windows.  It is expensive and the preserve
          of the wealthy.  The best glass products are of elven make.

        <include id="$Heraldry"/>
        <p>
          Different regional/cultural types may be specialties.  The
          ability to recognize heraldic achievements, and to blazon
          (properly describe) arms and recognize achievements.  The
          skill uses the <em>Recipe</em> and <em>Knowledge</em>
          dimensions.  One describes the achievements a character can
          actively reproduce/draw, the other the recognized
          achievements, if seen.  A 100% value means the set of all
          achievements the character has been in contact with.
          Reading a heralds&#8217; scroll suffices.  The OML is
          reduced to -10, if examples are not available.

          Uses the <em>Recipe</em>, <em>Yield</em>, <em>Yield
          (Time)</em>, and <em>Knowledge</em> dimensions.  The latter
          dimension describes the recognized herbs, if seen.  The 100%
          value means the set of all herbs the character has been in
          contact with.  Reading elaborate texts suffices, but may
          give inaccurate interpretations in the True:False dimension.
          A trajectory on the two dimensions should be provided.

        <p>
          Determines quality of furs or hides cured, and the quality
          of leather goods produced.  ML is modified by the quality
          and availability of tools and materials.  Rough-curing
          (removing a hide from a carcass and preparing it for
          transport and proper tanning) can be done in the wilderness
          with only some crude tools.  Uses the <em>Recipes</em>

        </p>
        <h5 class="skill" id="sk-ini">Initiative</h5>
        <include id="$Initiative"/>
        <p>
          Initiative reflects battle experience, discipline, and
          morale.  Initiative determines the speed in which characters
          can assess a stressful situation.  Instead of rolling a
          general awareness roll, the characters take the time listed
          before they can act.  An ambush and similar situations can
          give a bonus (for the ambushing party) as can the general
          awareness that combat is imminent.  Sleeping and other
          unawareness situations may incur hefty penalties.  General
          penalties apply.
        </p>
        <p>
          During the time a character is &#8220;frozen&#8221; this
          way, he is trying to understand the situation he is in and
          assesses the options he has.  He is catious during that
          time.  General awareness issues such as during an ambush are
          not covered by Initiative.
        </p>
        <p>
          Battle-hardened characters may come into the fractional
          range often.  Optionally fractions can be used to determine
          who goes first.  The GM determines, whether going first
          impedes the action of another already in the second that
          action culminates.  This changes the drama of simultaneous
          activity, which may or may not be appropriate.

          The ability to assess and/or act effectively within a
          social/political situation over a period of time.  Intrigue
          is used as a discretionary shortcut by the GM to avoid the
          playing out of an information-gathering process.  For
          example, an NPC&#8217;s Intrigue might be tested when sent
          by a PC to gather intelligence in a town or camp.

        <p>
          Determines the quality of jewelry and/or fine metalwork made
          by the character.  ML depends on the complexity of the task
          attempted.  Materials are necessary and failure can be
          expensive.  This skill is also used to appraise gems, fine
          metalwork, and/or jewelry.  Uses the <em>Recipe</em>
          dimension.

        <h5 class="skill" id="sk-jum">Jumping</h5>
        <include id="$Jumping"/>
        <p>
          Jumping is tested when a character attempts to leap for
          height or distance.  Results assume a running start; for
          standing jumps, halve heights and distances.  Results below
          0 turn into a Fall.  For each 5 levels of dimension that are
          also accepted as fall, increase ML by 1 point.

          Each Language is a separate skill.  All characters begin
          with at least one native Tongue, determined by birthplace.
          Some characters may be bilingual.  The GM will tell you the
          name of your native tongue(s).  Clerics also know their
          church language.  (These are not specialties.)  Languages
          are tested only on special occasions, such as when
          foreigners converse.  Characters are presumed to speak their
          native tongues at their social class level, which is well
          enough to make success rolls unnecessary in general.  If
          needed, the duration of the result is a speech, a dialog, or

          Used to determine efficiency and/or yield when milling
          grain, etc.  Milling is primarily a way to earn money.  It
          is usually not a very exciting activity nor a useful skill
          for adventurers.  The basic unit of yield is a year&#8217;s
          worth of grain as produced by agriculture.  It assumes that
          a mill capable of such output is available.  Use the

        <p>
          Knowledge of geology and ability at prospecting,
          mineworking, and ore-refining.  Prospecting is a complex
          issue, depending on the terrain surveyed and the minerals
          sought.  These include mythral, gold, silver, copper, tin,
          lead, zinc, coal, salt, iron, and a large variety of
          gemstones.

        <include id="$Morale"/>
        <p>
          Morale is a complex issue, it usually applies only to NPCs
          (and trained animals).  The higher a result, the more likely
          the predetermined objectives are followed, usually a
          military one.  The lower the result, the more
          self-preservation is deterministic of actions, but also
          instincts take over.  &#8220;Freezing &#8221; in the hopes
          of being ignored may make sense with certain predators but
          not when facing Gargun.  The variety of different reactions
          is huge.  See the Morale section in Combat.  Berserk is
          meant as option, not as mandatory.  The other end at -15 is
          mandatory.  It often makes sense to keep a current level of
          Morale for NPCs that is deducted until it reaches a breaking
          point.  Determine the outcome before any combat ensues to
          improve playability.  (It should be kept secret from
          players.)

        <p>
          Humans can accelerate and decelerate as 3 m/s each second.
          Turning options are in parts of a full circle (centered
          around the direction of travel).  E.g. at 3 m/s this means
          60&#176; off the direction of travel on either side per
          second.  For the sake of playability variance in this should
          be suppressed, although a 20% spread (for a 10 level
          difference) with Agility modification could be appropriate.
        </p>
        <p>
          Since steeds and (animal-powered) vehicles are important on
          H&#226;rn, the table is extended beyond the human range.
          Humans max out at 9m/s at optimum.

        <include id="$D-Move"/>
        <p>
          A steed&#8217;s movement rate must be declared before
          starting to move.  Effective movement is equal to its Move
          minus Steed Physical Penalty, then indexed in the Move table
          to find speed.  Horses have four rates of speed: Walk/40,
          Trot/60, Canter/80, and Gallop/100.  The number indicates
          the maximum speed that can be reached.  All speeds are
          available at all riding skills, although commanding the
          horse to use it may prove a challenge.  Horses/Steeds
          accelerate and decelerate at 6 m/s each second, but have the
          same turning options.

        <p>
          <em>Rotation</em> (also while standing) takes 1 second for
          360 degree revolution (Acrobatic tricks apply) for bipeds,
          which is modified by physical penalty and rounded off.

          When the internal system has become incapacitated due to
          fatigue, often from drowning, this means breathing has
          stopped and the lungs have potentially filled with water or
          another toxic substance).  When this condition has changed,
          breathing theoretically can return to normal and
          resuscitation may be attempted.  The <em>Resuciation</em>
          dimension is equal to the <em>Recipe</em> dimension in
          values.  The value in this dimension is the number of
          fatigue points a physician removes immediately.  Such an
          attempt may only be made once per subject every minute (by
          the same or different people).  Multiple people working in
          concert may use 5-Addition.
        </p>
        <p>
          Healing rate is used for wounds/injury.  A physician designs
          a treatment that must continually be applied with a first
          roll.  A second roll must be made during the time the
          physician actively applies a treatment (possibly identified
          by another colleague).  The minimum value from these two
          rolls is applied during the healing process.  Often the
          quality of medicine is another factor that comes into play,
          this depends on the therapy.  (From the rules it follows
          that the difficulty for first and second roll can be
          increased by 5 for a combined roll.)

        <div class="explain">
          <p>
            <em>Possession:</em> An alien spirit may possess a
            physical body by winning a mental conflict with the
            resident spirit.  Possession is easier if the native
            spirit is absent (disembodied) as an astral.  Reduce the
            ML by 1 for each 5% of Aura that is missing from the
            resident Aura.  The losing spirit suffers Dissolution.  An
            evicted spirit may later attempt to repossess its own body
            (or another) with a mental conflict.  Remember that the
            native spirit (if any) always has +5 to ML.
          </p>
          <p>
            <em>Ethereal Conflict:</em> Two ethereals meet and do
            battle.  The losing spirit suffers dissolution.
          </p>
          <p>
            <em>Artifact Control:</em> A character tries to invoke a
            major artifact&#8217;s powers and the artifact resists.

          <p>
            <em>Benign Mind Linking:</em> Some healers, for example,
            use mental linking as a way to diagnosis a patient&#8217;s
            ailments.  The willing bonus implies an &#8220;Ignore

          </p>
        </div>
        <p>
          <em>Dissolution:</em> Dissolution is the scattering of a
          spirit&#8217;s &#8220;substance&#8221;.  It reforms in p5
          hours at the location of the spirit&#8217;s physical body
          (if it has one), otherwise in a nearby location.  When the
          process is complete, the spirit regains consciousness, has
          no fatigue, and may now engage in another mental conflict.

        <p>
          <em>Exorcism:</em> A 5th Circle ritual invocation to aid a
          native spirit with evicting a possessing alien spirit.  The
          ritual requires frequent laying on of hands and Holy Water.
          The effect is to increase Mental Conflict ML.  See Religion.
        </p>
        <p>
          Mental Conflict Example.  The demon Karpek (ML 26) seeks to
          possess the Peonian priestess Larinda (ML 18).  Larinda is
          +15 for being the native spirit and living (ML 33).  Karpek
          rolls +9 and Larinda rolls -3, resulting in fatigue rates 1
          per minute for Larinda and 6 per 10 minutes for Karpek.  A
          few successful shock rolls later, Larinda invokes
          Peoni&#8217;s Mercy, a ritual invocation that could force
          the demon to depart.  Her Fatigue at that point is (-2) and
          the Circle Modifier (-4), which reduces her Ritual ML to 12
          and she fails the roll.  The process continues.  This time
          she fails the next Shock roll, allowing the demon its
          possession.  Larinda&#8217;s spirit is evicted and suffers
          dissolution.  Her body now obeys the demon&#8217;s wishes.
          Larinda&#8217;s spirit will reform after her (spirit) injury
          of 4 points are healed and she may then attempt to repossess
          her body (+5 for being a Native Spirit) with a mental
          conflict.  Larinda plans to use the ritual invocation
          Exorcism to aid her task.

        <h5 class="quality" id="di-qua">Quality</h5>
        <p>
          The Quality dimension can be used when a craftsman attempts
          to produce an item from raw materials.  The result is an
          added to the base value to find the new value.  An item with
          quality less than its base is usually broken.  The results
          obtained do not necessarily reflect market value.  Just
          because an item has +5 quality to its base does not mean
          anyone will pay the difference in pence.  Some finished
          goods may involve several stages of enhancement.  Uncut gems
          may be enhanced by cutting and then further enhanced by
          mounting in a gold-based necklace.  Sometimes an
          item&#8217;s resistance to damage is more important than how
          beautiful it looks.  Examples of this are weapon- and
          armour-crafting.

          For NPCs the associated table can be used to estimate the

          should rather keep a book and start with what their master
          has given them.  Self-made dabblers start with zero (0) and

        <p>
          In general, learning a recipe is a roll with the
          student&#8217;s ML.  The student should have a quiet,
          dedicated space to study.  The <em>Consecrated Ground</em>
          modifier usually can be 5-added to the ML.  A scripture must
          be read in full.  Recipes have a circle rating, ranging from
          I - VI, or given as star rating.  This is a direct numeric
          penalty when applying the recipe, e.g. performing the
          ritual.  For learning it represents the difficulty, see the
          star-rating dimension.  Calculate the modifiers and make a
          learning roll on the table below.  Any result below zero (0)
          means the time was spent in vain.  Particularly nasty GMs

          The ability to impress or persuade crowds or individuals by
          logic, eloquence, or charisma.  This is something of a
          shortcut skill and discretionary.  An orating PC needs to
          define the audience; mobs maybe stupider than individuals,
          but they cannot be persuaded to step off a cliff.  Rhetoric
          ML cannot exceed the orator&#8217;s or the audience&#8217;s
          ML in the language being used.  Rhetoric has many uses, from
          the apprehended thief trying to fast-talk his way out of a
          visit to the dungeon, to a friar explaining the mysteries of
          faith to a child.  Rhetoric ML may be reduced or increased
          considering the targets&#8217; Intelligence and their best
          interest.  A net result below 0 on any use of Rhetoric
          suggests the character has made a fool of himself and may

        <include id="$Riding"/>
        <p>
          Riding is used to determine the ability to ride/control a
          steed.  It is tested, whenever the rider attempts to command
          a steed in combat.  A negative result implies a fall.  For
          riders with less skill, an arbitrary (5-addition) penalty to
          the EML roll may be taken.  This penalty is applied to the
          (unmodified) roll but also serves as falling threshold to
          the roll.  The GM can rule a common Riding maneuver for
          nultiple tasks.  For example, Juryn tries to ride a mount
          with top speed of 50 (12 m/s).  With his skill of 0, he
          tries to play it safe and uses a penalty of 10.  He rolls a
          -5, which is greater than -10, so luckily he stays on the
          horse, but with a -15 he only makes 12 m/s.  His cousin
          Jirun has a skill of 25 and needs to jump a chasm, so he
          pushes the horse with a +15.  Rolling a 5, he has a total of
          45, he lucky (as 25 - 15 is greater then 5) and runs his
          horse for about 13 m/s and jumps his horse for 6.3m.
          Consult Mounted Combat for potential injuries.

          A success will permit the command as desired (and possible).
          At 0 the command fails.  This effects speed changes and
          turning, failures will have the steed continue what it did
          or what Morale dictates.  After three successive failures,
          assume the steed has a mind of its own until the situation
          changes significantly.

          An Unhorsing roll needs to be made, when the rider enters
          the saddle.  Note: A rider Stumble generated by an Melee
          Attack requires an additional Unhorsing Roll.  Unhorsing
          Rolls are made against zero (0), modified by Physical
          Penalty (including any injury just received).  On failure,
          the rider is thrown and suffers a 5 feet plus deceleration
          distance fall.  War Saddle: Gives a bonus of 5 to Unhorsing

          Most know something about their own religion, at least
          enough to attend church services without seeming too
          ignorant.  For different religions (or if the
          character&#8217;s culture, social class, or family is
          irreligious), then OML is at -10.  There is a separate skill
          for each religion.  Appropriate training, divine revelation,
          or study materials are needed to earn development rolls.

        <p>
          Stealth is tested when a character attempts to move without
          being detected.  The attempt presumes reasonable conditions.
          ML is further modified for distance to the target, available
          cover, etc.  Awareness of potential observers is deducted
          from ML, i.e. added to difficulty.
        </p>
        <h5 class="skill" id="sk-str">Strength</h5>
        <include id="$Strength"/>
        <p>
          The listed weight excluding your own body can be lifted.  At
          that point any activity is at -10.  This penalty scales
          linearly down or up with additional weight, any fraction of
          the weight carried also incurs the same fraction of -10 as
          penalty.  Note that with certain penalties usually trivial
          activities (i.e. no roll required) become difficult, for
          instance not stumbling.  Still without tools, activity with
          both hands is impossible.  Freeing one hand incurs twice the
          penalty and assumes that the weight is liftable that way.
          Fatigue is accrued at the 1 point per 10 seconds for the
          maximum lift.  Fractions (which cannot exceed 1) of that
          lift generate the corresponding fractional fatigue rate.
          E.g. lifting half the maximum weight gives 3 points per
          minute (or 1 per 20 seconds).  Only simple fractions are
          allowed.  See Endurance for a modification to fatigue.

        <h5 class="skill" id="sk-swi">Swimming</h5>
        <include id="$Swimming"/>
        <p>
          Difficulty of swimming conditions is rated on the Beaufort
          scale.  Test Swimming once for each continuous swim without
          rest.  Any interruption requires a new roll.  With a result
          below 0 the character starts to sink.  Consider currents for
          speed determination.  A swimmer accumulates one Fatigue
          Level for every minute of swimming at speed, but may rest by
          treading water.  A resting swimmer rolls to see if they
          sink, but does not move (except with the current).
          Underwater Swimming is at half speed.  When attempting to
          convey a conscious swimmer, apply a penalty of 5, for an
          unconscious person apply a penalty of 10.
        </p>
        <include id="$D-Swimming"/>
        <p>
          If a character is in water deeper than their height, a Sink
          result implies the character goes down with the speed of the
          negative result.  (I.e. -5 means going down at 0.5 m/s.)  A
          reroll may be attempted every second, but fatigue applies
          immediately.  A character who can no longer hold his breath
          (see Endurance) and spends more (consecutive) time
          underwater than they can hold their breath passes out, the
          character&#8217;s lungs fill with water, they stop
          breathing, and the character will receive Drowning damage.
          An unconscious character removed from the water may be
          revived with standard Physician/healing mechanisms.

        <h5 class="skill" id="sk-thr">Throwing</h5>
        <include id="$Throwing"/>
        <p>
          Throwing for accuracy is covered under Missile Combat.  When
          throwing for distance, an ideal throwing object is
          spherical, weighs three ounces and fits comfortably in the
          hand.  An ideal situation is one where the thrower has room
          to swing arms, good footing, and no distractions.  Heavier
          objects reduce ML.  When throwing with little/no attempt at
          accuracy, the table indicates the distance an ideal object

        <p>
          The <em>Km</em> distance dimensions <em>Sail</em> and
          <em>Land</em> show the distance travelled in a day.  The
          corresponding time dimensions show the time needed to travel
          100 km.  In order to have a reasonable travel rate, the
          desired distance and a maximum time should be given.  With
          enough bad luck or circumstances, reaching the destination
          may not be possible.  Turning around is possible, when
          pressing on may by more dangerous.  The hazard domain cannot
          be turned into a trajectory, i.e. no arbitrary bonus

          A classic skill value resolves to 10 for each &#9733;, but
          attributes behave different.  Generally, attributes are
          added directly to skills or difficulties as do other
          circumstancial modifiers, while skills 5-add when grouped.

          One way to determine how many talent are made for a new
          character, the GM secretly rolls n5 and adds Aura.  For
          example, with a n5 roll of 0 and an Aura of 5, a character
          would get five talents.  Alternative, a character with at
          least an Aura of 10, may select or roll Psionic talents with
          total skill points of AUR - 10.

          <em>Sin, Piety, &#0038; Morality</em>: If a character acts
          in a manner inconsistent with their god&#8217;s morality,
          the GM should deduct Piety depending on the extent of the
          sin.  Sin penalties can be imposed directly, but subtle
          deductions by the GM are better.  The GM may also adjust a
          character&#8217;s Morality based upon actions over time.
          Characters with a Piety total that equals or exceeds their
          Ritual Mastery are said to have Divine Grace.
        </p>
        <p>
          Some rituals are lay rituals as described in the Religion
          chapter.  The may be attended by laymen to receive a
          benefit.  Some need a priest as guidance.  The following is
          a Piety benefit, if attended and an (individual&#8217;s)
          Ritual roll succeeds.  The benefit is a 5-Addition to Piety.
          (Any rituals must be relevant, of course.  Individual
          donations of 1d for a rich merchant, for instance, do not
          qualify.)

          Divine intervention is totally at the GMs discretion and the
          seemingly high chances are mostly from self-reports of
          particularly faithful clerics.
        </p>
        <h3 id="c3ombat">Combat</h3>
        <p>
          At the beginning of each combat the players and GM should
          jointly decide which action options they want to allow and
          which will simply be abstracted by a set penalty/bonus by
          the GM.  This can speed up combat tremendously.  If tactical
          options outside of combat are affected by the decision, the
          GM should inform the players of that.  For instance, if
          mounted combat is to tedious today, than the PCs might just
          as well dismount already to allow for smoother combat
          resolution.  The main option Melee and Missile should never
          be removed.
        </p>
        <p>
          <em>A/D:</em> Weapons give bonuses to combat skills based on
          their effectiveness to attack or defend.  A Roundshield, for
          example, rated as 1/4, is poor for attacking, but excellent
          for defense.  The ML used in combat when attacking with a
          weapon adds the first (A) value.  The Attack ML of a Spear
          (A:4) at ML18 is: 18+4 = 22.  The ML used in combat when
          defending with a weapon adds the second (D) value.
          <em>HM</em> is also directly added to ML.  <em>WQ</em> is
          used as skill, not as attribute.
        </p>
        <p>
          In order to simulate larger combats with many participants,
          the usual 5-Addition can be used.  It does not provide as
          many tactical options as individual combat does, but greatly
          reduces time spent.  Both time and wound dimension should be
          scaled linearly with the number of particpipants.  E.g. a
          wound of 5 after 30 seconds would scale to a total of 50
          points after 5 minutes for 10 people or to 500 points after
          50 minutes for 100 people.  The points should be distributed
          in reasonable batches on the participants on each side, the
          smallest batch size being the wounds rolled.  People can be
          hit multiple times, but points beyond 40 generally
          don&#8217;t make sense unless explosives, catapults, or
          similar are involved.

            <em>Rest:</em> Fatigue gained by any conflict recovers at
            one Fatigue Level every minute.  With dissolution, fatigue
            turns into injury.  Note that spirits can take arbitrary
            injury before being destroyed and may heal forever.  Only
            in rare cases (e.g. divine intervention) can spirits be
            destroyed.
          </p>
          <p>
            <em>Move:</em> Use the Move skill to determine speed.
            Subtract 2 from Missile ML for being mounted.  Subtract
            the speed difference in m/s between attacker and defender
            perpendicular to the shot direction.  To avoid lengthy
            calculations, subtract 50% of the attacker speed instead.
          </p>
          <p>
            <em>Engage:</em> Because the potential exists to
            attack/influence entities that come within range, each
            character has an <em>Engagement Zone</em> of 1m plus
            weapon length radius about his center (that does not
            extend into blocked areas).  The Engagement Zone of a
            conscious, prone character is only half that around his
            body.  This means a standing character is often not
            engaged by an adjacent prone enemy, although the prone
            character may be engaged by the standing character.
            Similarly, two adjacent prone characters often do not
            engage each other.  Unconscious characters have no
            Engagement Zones (not even the space their own body
            occupies) but may constitute obstacles.  A character may
            be (melee) attacked upon entering an enemy&#8217;s
            Engagement Zone until he leaves that zone.  This entering
            or leaving may be active or passive.  It is possible to be
            engaged with an arbitrary number of enemies at a time.  A
            character with a long reach weapon has an appropriately
            larger engagement zone and may therefore be eligible to
            attack before others.  This may be of importance for
            mounted Charges into a row of Pikemen.  Also note the
            restriction on using long weapons at short range.  If
            combat extends into the third dimension, assume the
            volumetric &#8220;center&#8221; of a character to be a 1m
            vertical line centered on their true center (when
            upright).  Horses have a two meter long horizontal line
            (when upright) centered on their true center.  More
            bizarre creatures may have more bizarre engagement zones,
            even when not fighting in three dimensions.
          </p>
          <p>
            <em>Charge:</em> Requiring a steed to halt may imply
            multiple attacks due to deceleration restrictions.  Every
            engagement along the way may attack the steed/rider as
            usual.  If the intent is to cause little damage, use the
            unintentional hit rules for melee (see below).  Otherwise
            consider the group passed by to be the target and scale as
            per wild result in the missile attack section.  Instead of
            the 60 degrees +/-2 distance, collect all in the path of 5
            feet width.  Any attacker plunging into defenders with an
            attack will decelerate at maximum rate, and that
            automatically determines the length of the path and the
            duration of the ride.  At the riders discretion this can
            be broken down into separate attacks.  A forced
            deceleration beyond what is normally allowed results in a
            fall impact for the rider and steed as from height equal
            to the forced decelaration minus the maximum allowed
            deceleration.  E.g. 10 m/s end speed with a possible
            allowed decelaration of 3 m/s equals a fall from 7 m.
            Note that the fall impact also alpplies the targets fallen
            into.  This is the charge bonus, where the 3 m/s are not
            deducted.  A rider is not forced to halt his steed, but it
            usually requires a riding maneuver to not cause the steed
            to halt on its own, fire or similar incentives
            notwithstanding.
          </p>
          <p>
            <em>Push:</em> The push attempt must be in the direction
            the attacker is facing and the attacker must follow.  The
            defender has a choice to evade into a semi-circle of up to
            120 degrees, assuming no obstacles.  Instead of Injury
            points, the number of meters pushed are used.  The
            defender is forced to deduct the move from his action
            allowance, regardless of whether he resists or not.  A
            resist deducts from the distance forced and can even be
            used as a counter-push.  The pushed character may opt to
            fall prone instead at any time, for instance to avoid
            falling of a cliff.  Any remaing distance is forfeit.

            <em>Rise:</em> Use Acrobatics skill.
          </p>
          <p>
            <em>Grope:</em> Use Dexterity skill.
          </p>
          <p>
            <em>Melee Attack:</em> The rider and horse may act in
            unison and add their combat skill per 5-Addition.  Both
            accrue the same fatigue.  Hitting the wrong target can
            happen in melee combat.  Usually this is ignored, but if
            this ignorance is taken into account (out-world) when
            deciding on options, such accidents shall be played out.
            Anybody within the range of the weapon is subject to a
            skill roll with a penalty of 10. This can be added to the
            benefit of other attackers as per multiple attacks above
            or resolved individually with the goal of 0 damage.
          </p>
          <p>
            <em>Missile Attack:</em> For throwing arbitrary objects,
            use Throwing skill.  Since missile attacks are resolved
            with individual shots, a missed attack is applied only if
            the intended attack had no impact.  Count all potential
            targets completely in an arc of 60 degrees and +/-2 range
            levels of the intended target.  Use 5-Addition of zeroes,
            but reduce by 5 for the missed, intended opponent.  If a
            hit is scored on the much larger
            &#8220;super-target&#8221;, roll which individual target
            is hit by distributing evenly among all the unintended
            targets.  When determining hit chances and damage apply
            the size modifier from the Size table below.  At GM
            discretion, inanimate objects not participating in the
            skirmish may be counted as potential targets,
            particularly, if the actual targets are spread widely
            across the area.  This increase can be used purposefully
            and can be quite devastating when firing at advancing
            troops. The Missile Attack table below reduces calculation
            for playability.  Penetrating hits are ignored, i.e. no
            shots through multiple targets.  The assumed skills rolls
            all use 0 damage and no personal, e.g. aiming, modifiers.
          </p>
          <p>
            <em>Grapple/Tangle Attack/Defense:</em> Use Unarmed Combat
            skill when no weapon is involved.  The basic radius of the
            two characters engaged is 5-added.  Multiple Grapples are
            allowed , but keep track of the grappled weapons of all
            opponents, they can no longer be used to full potential.
            Also observe any secondary considerations for odd Grapple
            attempts, e.g. grappling a horse&#8217;s hind leg.
          </p>
          <p>
            <em>Block/Dodge:</em> For dodging, use Dodge skill.  Dodge
            and Block/Parry are added through 5-Addition, if used
            together.
          </p>
          <p>
            <em>Steed Trample:</em> Use steed ML (and penalties) only.
          </p>
          <p>
            <em>Polearm Defense:</em> Remember the Reach of Long
            weapons.  Usually Steed Stumble Roll, followed by an
            Unhorsing Roll is necessary to continue a Charge into
            polearms (assuming the Steed Command Check was
            successful).
          </p>
          <p>
            <em>Esoteric Attack/Defense, Dropping Items, Ignore,
            Mount/Dismount, Mounted Move:</em> No further out-world
            exlpanation is necessary.  If useful, subactions here and
            elsewhere can be extracted that should become possible
            during a specific out-world handling of combat.  Rewrite
            the rules here to accomodate this.  The missing tactical
            option is compensated by an appropriate penalty/bonus if
            the action is still taken in-world.
          </p>
          <p>
            <em>Aiming:</em> The Attacker may declare one Main area as
            not being hit for a penalty of 1 to ML.  This choice can
            be taken multiple times, but the remaining Main locations
            must remain (bodily) connected.  If all but one Main
            location has been eliminated, individual percentage points
            may be reduced for a Detail area.  This penalty can again
            be taken multiple times but the remaining Detail hit
            locations must be (bodily) connected.  The GM may restrict
            or penalize the choice of Aiming Zone if the attacker
            could only reach certain target zones with the declared
            attack weapon.  A prone attacker would find it difficult
            to aim high on a standing opponent with a melee weapon.
            The Size table can be used, if the target is smaller than
            man-sized.  This effect does not cummulate with aiming for
            parts of a target (the main part of this paragraph).
            There is no modification for man-sized creatures, unless
            the target offers a smaller effective target.  A prone
            man, for example, presents a target about 2 feet tall, and
            a crouching man about 4 feet tall.  Similar height
            adjustments may apply to other targets at GM discretion.
          </p>
          <p>
            <em>Outnumbered:</em> The ML for any defense is decreased
            by 2 for each engaged enemy above one that is not ignored.
            (This includes prone enemies.)  That is, a character
            outnumbered 3:1 subtracts 4 from ML for all defense rolls
            during that period.
          </p>
          <p>
            <em>Prone:</em> A character who is attacking (or being
            attacked by) a prone enemy increases Attack/Defense EML
            with tha character by 4.
          </p>
          <p>
            <em>Stop:</em> A stop from a sprint/charge faster than the
            maximum natural deceleration rate may be necessary.
            (Running into a wall or head on into another opponent that
            doesn&#8217;t dodge.)  In that case consider the distance
            that is not available to stopping as fall.  Surface is
            considered at 30&#176;.  This damage is taken by the steed
            (or the runner).  An appropriate strike location should be
            chosen.  If the obstacle is reasonably capable of taking
            damage apply it there too.  (If desired, use physics of an
            inelastic collision, i.e. when running into a wagon that
            starts to roll when run into.  Damage always applies to
            both parties of a collision.) Also see Charge.

            <em>Fall:</em> Acrobatics can be used to moderate a fall,
            but the &#8220;falling&#8221; character must modify the
            roll by any Grapple hinderance or if in the saddle, for
            example.  All successful points on Acrobatics vs 25 can be
            used by the faller as in Aiming, i.e. the main and
            detailed body part to land on.  The slope of the surface
            may cause a falling climber to hit several times on the
            way down.  When this occurs, reduce damage to what the
            incline is as part of 90&#176;.  E.g. 30&#176; would
            reduce the damage to 1/3.  A character may be able to stop
            falling by grabbing protrusions, bushes, etc.  This rarely
            stops the fall, but may slow it and reduce landing impact.
            Randomize an M1 type B wound to the hands and deduct 1 ft
            from the height.  The wound impact can be increased up to
            M10 for a corresponding reduction.  If so desired, the
            fall can be stopped at a random location and the falling
            damage recalculated.  Damage is then aimed with +20 at the
            grabbing arm.  This grabbing cannot be used together with
            Acrobatics.  The character now hangs from the protrusion.
            Falls use the Fall table.  Various surfaces modify fall
            impact: <em>Water (up to 10 ft):</em> -1 / ft.  <em>Mud,
            Bog:</em> -2.  <em>Stone:</em> +3.  <em>Uneven,
            Rocks:</em> +6.
          </p>
          <p>
            <em>Close Mode:</em> Subtract 1 for each significant
            impediment reaching into an engagement zone in the
            direction of the two enemies.  For Multiple impediments
            only choose the greater intrusion.  A blanket counts as
            significant, as does a wooden beam.  A feather bush does
            not.
          </p>
          <p>
            <em>Jousting: </em> Each opponent is attacker and defender
            at the same time and the result is determined through
            normal ML rolls.  Use the following tactical modifiers.
          </p>
          <p>
            The chance for the pole to break is equal to the impact it
            causes (before armor reduction).  The chance for a shield
            to break is the amount of damage is absorbs (provided it
            is hit).  If the shield breaks, reduce strike impact by 3
            further points.  If your pole does not break, your
            opponent may be injured.  Determine Strike Location and
            effective impact normally.  Because there is more chance
            of being struck on the left side of the body, roll 1d4 for
            strike locations with two sides: 1-3 = left; 4 = right.
            If the location struck is covered by a shield (see above)
            a shield damage check is made.  If the shield does not
            break, it deflects the strike and there is no effective
            impact.  Otherwise, determine injury effect as normal.
            Any strike, including one by a broken pole, requires an
            Unhorsing Roll.  Also, if the strike impact exceeds the
            target&#8217;s STR (before armour reduction) an unhorsing
            roll is required.

          <em>Drowning:</em> While incapacitated, the internal system
          takes 1 injury and 1 fatigue point every 6 seconds until
          fresh air is available.
        </p>
        <p>
          <em>Bloodloss:</em> damage taken increases at Impact - 10
          (&#9733;) per 10s.  For example, a 12 point injury causes 2
          points per 10 seconds, or 1 point of bloodloss to accrue
          every 5 seconds.  (A 22 destroying wound causes more than 1
          point per second in bloodloss and only very unlikely
          circumstances will keep the victim alive for long.)  At GM
          discretion some wounds will not cause bloodloss (e.g. Frost)
          including inanimate objects.
        </p>
        <p>
          <em>Inanimate Damage:</em> Instead of (autonomous) Healing,
          Repair must be applied externally.  Use the appropriate
          Craft skill instead of Physician.
        </p>
        <p>
          <em>Weapon/Armor Damage:</em> Weapon and Armour make a Shock
          roll for the damage that they absorb, respectively deal.
          This includes grappling damage.  Weapon Quality (WQ) is used
          instead of Stamina skill.
        </p>
        <p>
          <em>Fumble:</em> Any new wound of at least 1 point to arms
          results in a Fumble chance.  Use accumulated damage to that
          extremity as difficulty for a Dexterity skill roll against
          10 (&#9733;).  Failure results in dropping anything held on
          that arm.
        </p>
        <p>
          <em>Stumble:</em> Any new wound of at least 1 point to legs
          results in a stumble chance.  Use accumulated damage to that
          extremity as difficulty for an Agility skill roll against 10
          (&#9733;).  Failure results in dropping prone.
        </p>
        <p>
          <em>Shock:</em> Any new wound of at least 1 point results in
          a Shock chance.  Use accumulated injury and fatigue as
          difficulty for a Stamina skill roll against 20
          (&#9733;&#9733;).  Failure results in unconsciousness.

        <h4 id="morality">Morality</h4>
        <p>
          Individuals should have a moral compass.  Morality is a
          measure of unselfishness.  The following serves as a
          guideline of the diversity found in H&#226;rnworld, but is
          by no means exhaustive.  Sindarin tend towards the higher
          moral standards.
        </p>
        <p>
          Customary description of Morality include: <em>Diabolical,
          Unscrupulous, Corruptible, Law-Abiding, Principled,
          Exemplary.</em> They are not always applied correctly when
          dealing with enemies or friends.  Moral description from
          others tend to be worse when describing an enemy.
        </p>
        <h4 id="sexuality">Sexuality</h4>
        <p>
          People have a descriptive sexuality.  The distribution of
          sexuality in H&#226;rn is roughly 90% heterosexual, 5%
          bi-sexual and 5% homosexual.  Other forms of sexuality may
          exist but are hidden.
        </p>
        <h4 id="species">Species</h4>
        <p>
          Although H&#226;rn has many exotic creatures, Humans,
          Sindarin and Khuzdul are by far the most commonly
          encountered.  The population distribution on H&#226;rn is
          approximately Human (97%), Sindarin (1%), and Khuzdul (1%).
        </p>
        <h4 id="gender">Gender</h4>
        <p>
          Among encountered humans 48% are male, among Sindarin 45%,
          and among Khuzdul 75%.  (Other individuals encountered are
          female.)
        </p>
        <h4 id="birthdate">Birthdate</h4>
        <p>
          Every day of the year (360) has an equal probability of
          being the birthday of a random person.  In other words: they
          are evenly distributed.  Names of calendar months are
          readily available in other sections of H&#226;rnworld.
        </p>
        <h4 id="sunsign">Sunsign</h4>
        <p>
          Sunsign is a major factor for skill-affinity, but all
          sunsigns have advantages and disadvantages.  Sunsign is
          determined by birthdate.  The first two and last two days of
          each sign are termed the cusp: a person born on the 1st of
          Ilvin is termed a Tai-Skorus Cusp (the actual sunsign is
          named first).  Those born on the cusp enjoy the benefits of
          either sign.  H&#226;rnic astrology reveals the Pvaric
          nature of Kelestia.  Personality descriptions for each of
          the twelve signs of the zodiac are given in H&#226;rnPlayer.
          The personality of a person born on the cusp would be a
          blend of the two signs.
        </p>
        <include id="$Sunsigns"/>
        <h4 id="birthplace">Birthplace</h4>
        <p>
          H&#226;rnWorld regional modules provide Birthplace
          generation tables.  The GM may assign you a birthplace, or
          tell you what dice to roll to generate one on these tables.
        </p>
        <h4 id="culture">Culture</h4>
        <p>
          A person&#8217;s Culture is determined by Birthplace.  Most
          people born on H&#226;rn are Feudal.  Common exceptions are:
          Imperial (Tharda), Viking (Orbaalese), Tribal, Sindarin, and
          Khuzan.
        </p>
        <h4 id="socialclass">Social Class</h4>
        <p>
          The Social Class is usually not something considered random.
          The table shows the distribution of all classes, should a
          hypothetical census be taken.  It may be useful to determine
          the Social Class of a randomly encountered individual.  For
          some cultures a random result does not make sense
          (e.g. slaves in Kaldor).  Refer to the relevant
          H&#226;rnWorld publication.
        </p>
        <include id="$SocialClass"/>
        <h4 id="siblingrank">Sibling Rank</h4>
        <p>
          About a third of all individuals encountered are first-born.
          Of the remainder, a third is a second-born and so on.  For
          Sindarin and Khuzdul 50% are first-born and of the
          remainder, 50% are second-born instead.  The sex and age of
          each sibling may be determined accordingly, with a 60% of
          each still being alive.  To determine the number of
          siblings, determine the rank of the last sibling as before,
          but which obviously must come after the indiviual&#8217;s
          rank already determined.
        </p>
        <h4 id="parent">Parent</h4>
        <p>
          The individual&#8217;s Father and Mother represent an
          important aspect of an individual in a mostly feudal
          society.
        </p>
        <div class="explain">
          <p>
            <b>50%</b> of all people are regular offspring, the person
            is raised by his natural parents.  Of these cases, when a
            minor comes of age, 60% see both parents alive and living
            together, 20% see either the father or the mother absent
            (desertion, divorce, etc.).  In the remaining 20% either
            the father or mother is dead, in half of the cases the
            surviving spouse has remarried.
          </p>
          <p>
            <b>20%</b> of all people were fostered; they lived with
            another family for social, economic, or political reasons.
            Guilded apprentices are usually fostered with their
            masters, as are squires training for knighthood.  Poor
            families, especially those with only one parent, commonly
            foster one or more children with a relative or neighbor.
            Fostered children are usually aware of their
            parents&#8217; identity.
          </p>
          <p>
            <b>5%</b> of individuals were adopted by another family

            generally only done if both parents are dead, but there
            are exceptions if parental consent is given.  Adopted
            children are often unaware of the fact.
          </p>
          <p>
            <b>15%</b> are Bastards.  Parents never married, most
            likely because the father was of a higher social class, or
            one (or both) parents were already married or betrothed.
            Acknowledgement happens only in a third of all cases.  A
            bastard usually lives with his mother, but may reside with
            father if acknowledged.
          </p>
          <p>        
            <b>10%</b> of people are orphans, both father and mother
            are deceased.  Only 5% of orphans live alone, the others
            are either Fostered with another family/clan (80%) or
            adopted by another family/clan (15%).  Brothers and

        <p>
          It is the habit of the upper classes to spread their oats
          throughout the lower classes; if unacknowledged, the real
          father may never be known, but then again, he may be someone
          of wealth and power who could be helpful.  Acknowledging a
          bastard is a significant act; the admission can have
          important emotional ramifications for both parents,
          especially to their respective spouses.  In families where
          there is property and/or titles to inherit, acknowledged
          bastards usually follow the youngest legitimate heir, but
          dynamic characters may do better, especially if they happen
          to be a father&#8217;s eldest son and the legitimate heirs
          are weak.  Many a dynastic bonfire has been ignited with
          such a spark.
        </p>
        <h4 id="estrangement">Estrangement</h4>
        <p>
          Estrangement measures a person&#8217;s popularity in the
          clan, tribe, and/or family.  It has a significant effect on
          opportunities, including any inheritance.  Being the eldest
          child of a knight is less advantageous if he hates you.
          Siblings with different estrangements are often jealous of
          each other; this can produce interesting family politics.

        <h4 id="clanhead">Clanhead</h4>
        <p>
          A person&#8217;s relationship to the Clanhead is often more
          important than to parents.  H&#226;rnic clans tend to be
          large.  Some live in close proximity.  Some number in the
          thousands and are widely dispersed.  Wealthy and noble clans
          are often extended.  Poor clans are likely to be smaller,
          especially if they live in major settlements.  Poor families
          in the same town or district may have the same clan name,
          but have been out of touch for generations.  Except for
          outcast characters, the clanhead can always provide shelter
          and a hot meal.  In some cultures, maternal relationships
          are more important.

          The hypothetical census would have for a person: 15% father
          or mother as the clan head, 10% a cousin, 25% an aunt or

        <h4 id="height">Height</h4>
        <p>
          The average height of a H&#226;rnic male human is 68 inches
          with a variance of 5.83.  The average is modified: Sindarin:
          -3", Khuzdul: -14".  Human females: -2", Sindarin females:
          1".  Ivinian +1", nobility +2", urban poor -2".  Such
          measurements are often made by Physicians, while averages
          and variance thereof are only calculated by excentric
          scholars.

        <h4 id="weight">Weight</h4>
        <p>
          On H&#226;rn, the optimal weight of a person depends on his
          height and is determined by the Physician&#8217;s Guild and
          usually published in a yearly almanach.
        </p>
        <include id="$Weight"/>
        <p>
          The Clothiers&#8217; Guild and others have agreed on a size
          measure that relates to weight and is only a scale from
          1-10.  The apparent distribution of sizes is recorded here.
          Items that are too small or too big cause discomfort.  A one
          size difference may be acceptable.  The distribution was
          calculated on the human population alone.  Non-humans were
          too rare, when the data was sampled, but their sizes have
          been standardized by the guild none-the-less.  (Weight is in
          lbs.)

        <include id="$Height"/>
        <h4 id="frame">Frame</h4>
        <p>
          Frame is another proportional attribute mainly used by
          Clothiers.  It is measured in five main categories.  It is
          determined by the actual instead of the optimal weight to
          height ratio.  The optimal <em>Weight : Height</em> ratio is
          considered 100%.

          Complexion is the color of a person&#8217;s skin.  Human is
          for all people of H&#226;rnic ancestry.  Nordic humans are
          similar to Khuzdul.

        <p>
          A person&#8217;s attractiveness to the same species.
          Comeliness can be modified by cosmetics, but these
          enhancements usually wear off after some time.  The
          courtesan&#8217;s guild maintains these statistics.

        <include id="$Comeliness"/>
        <h4 id="physical">Physical</h4>
        <p>
          Physical ability is assessed by the military (including
          their physicians) and a five-star rating is used.
          Non-humans often have their own physiology - that is
          recognized in the statistics.  (The scale is extended to six
          stars for exceptional non-humans.)
        </p>
        <p>
          <em>Agility</em> moves the body.  Agility is useful for
          warriors, seamen, and dancers.
        </p>
        <p>
          <em>Dexterity</em> is the ability to manipulate objects with
          the hands.  Dexterity is important for warriors and
          cut-purses.
        </p>
        <p>
          <em>Stamina</em> is the general physiological condition.
          Stamina determines for how long wound healing takes and also
          affects disease and poison resistance.
        </p>
        <p>
          <em>Strength</em> is sheer physical power, a crucial
          attribute for combat and other physical activities, which is
          why military types usually assess it.  It is common
          knowledge that additional weight leads to increased
          strength.  However, this has not been measured accurately
          and not any weight leads to an increase in strength.  It is
          also unknown whether the same relationship to weight exists
          for Sindarin and Khuzdul.

        <p>
          Physicians collect the data for the senses, often diseases
          or poisons affect the senses and their origin can be
          determined by gauging their effects.  A five-star rating is
          used.  (The scale is extended to six stars for exceptional
          non-humans.)

          <em>Eyesight</em> is the ability to see in daylight.  Except
          for nocturnal creatures (like Gargun) eyesight is reduced in
          the dark and that affects all activity requiring vision.
        </p>
        <p>
          <em>Hearing</em> is used to sense sound.  This is essential
          for musicians.
        </p>
        <p>
          <em>Smell</em> estimates sensitivity to odor and taste.
          This can be useful for hunting and/or tracking, and may warn
          of danger.  Of course, in a medieval town, a keen sense of
          smell may well be a curse.

            <em>Allergy:</em> Common allergies are to pollen, hair,
            fur, feathers, wool, bee stings, or to foods such as eggs,
            milk, cereals, or shellfish.  When the substance is
            nearby, a person suffers from sneezing, wheezing, and
            coughing.  This results in reduced abilities until the
            allergy source is avoided or removed.  Eating allergic
            foods can cause serious illness or death - consider this

          Shek-Pvar and Priests collect the statistics for these

          <em>Aura</em> is Psionic concept.  H&#226;rnic philosophers
          believe that all living things have Aura and that the
          physical body is simply a place where the immortal spirit
          currently resides.  High Aura indicates high psychic
          ability, and is the most important attribute for Psionics

          <em>Will</em> encapsulates mental strength, tenacity, and
          patience.  A person with low Will lacks confidence, panics

          Phobias, manias, and other mental disorders can be
          disruptive.  The list of mental disorders is not
          comprehensive.  Mental disorders of the same type may have
          different severities.  A phobia is an irrational
          fear/aversion.  When likely to be stimulated by an
          appropriate situation, a person&#8217;s Will is tested to
          determine if the phobia can be resisted or not.  If relief
          is impossible, the person may faint, become hysterical, go
          berserk, etc.  A mania is an irrational fascination,
          obsession, or compulsion, usually to excess.  An individual
          with Pyromania takes every opportunity to start a fire; with
          Hydrophobia he is unlikely to enjoy swimming, boating, etc.
          Severity of the disorder is, of course, relevant in the
          actions that are taken.  Some disorders are only latent and
          the level of Severity is unknown.  It is quite possible for
          someone with Acrophobia to climb a mountain with no
          problems, but panic sitting atop a twenty feet wall.
          Phobias are irrational.

          Gods or goddesses may be worshiped (however laxly) by any
          person.  While people may respect and acknowledge the
          existence of any number of deities, they usually only follow
          one, although it is possible to change religion.  The
          religion a person may encounter depend on a lot of
          circumstances and depends on the birthplace.  Available
          choices are presented in other H&#226;rnworld publications,
          which also consider culture and social class.  Most people
          tend to follow the deity of their parents or guardians.
        </p>
        <p>
          While there are chivalrous worshipers of Morgath and corrupt
          Laranians, people tend to be more satisfied if their morals
          matches that of their deity.  Churches and clerics, unaware
          of an individual&#8217;s true morality, may be fooled.

          People may faithfully ascribe to two or more religions,
          provided the deities are not diametrically opposed.  Some
          miscreants may try to subvert an opposing religion, but this
          is not faithful.  Some rare people may consider themselves
          godless.  Divine intervention is another word for miracle.
          However, the acts of deities should never be confused with
          spells, which are the acts of mages.

          A simple peasant may possess little more the clothes worn, a
          knapsack containing their worldly possessions, credentials
          when appropriate, and a money-belt.  Most travel afoot, but
          nobles require a horse.  A person&#8217;s wealth is largely
          dependent on family wealth, which is relative to social
          status.  The census data compiled by the crowns provide the
          following table and shows three levels of wealth within each
          social class.  The value given amounts to what a person is
          assumed to possess when becoming of age, i.e. a responsible
          subject of the souvereign.  This wealth may be used on items
          from the Price List on H&#226;rnPlayer and the Weapon and

          Squires are traditionally equipped by their lord when
          knighted.  This includes weapons, armour, and a good steed.
          Family wealth above does not include this.  Very few
          H&#226;rnic folk own property.  Rural freemen and serfs rent
          cottages and land from the lord.  City homes are mostly
          owned by a few wealthy folk and rented to poorer citizens.
          Only established urban guildsmen can hope to buy a private
          home.  Most rural households own a few sheep or goats,
          perhaps a cow.  Some families raise pigs which are prolific
          breeders.  Wealthier households own oxen and rent them for
          village work in exchange for food and labor.  Only the
          wealthiest of peasants can afford to keep a bull or a horse.

          Clothes should suit a person&#8217;s station.  A tunic,
          leggings, hat, and sandals are bare essentials.  Some folk
          wear a robe or gown instead of a tunic.  Travelers normally
          have a knapsack containing portable tools of their trade.  A
          weaponcrafter, for example, must own hammers and tongs, but
          carrying an anvil is unlikely.  Nearly everyone carries some
          fire-making tools (tinderbox, or flint and steel) and a
          strip of cloth for a towel, bandage, or arm-sling.  A
          waterskin is also essential.
        </p>
        <p>
          Nearly everyone owns a knife or dagger.  Clubs, bows,
          hatchets, slings, and staves are also common.  Other weapons
          are expensive and <em>Bearing Arms</em> in H&#226;rnPlayer
          should be consulted.  Few young adults can afford good
          armour.  Military individuals are mostly equipped by their
          unit, but knights on feudal service must bring their own
          weapons, armour, and steed.
        </p>
        <p>
          Proving identity can be difficult on H&#226;rn.  A
          travelling person should have papers to prove guild rank (if
          any) and/or a letter of introduction from a prominent person
          such as a lord of the manor, or a cleric or sheriff, etc.
          Many guilds issue a badge or tattoo to prove rank.  The
          expensive weapons and armour carried by knights speak for
          themselves.

        <h1 id="occupations">Occupations</h1>
        <p>
          An occupation largely determines the skills a person learns
          during adolescense and the opportunities that follow, at
          least initially.  Occupation is not necessarily a life
          commitment.  Jobs can change during a life, although this
          might involve lengthy re-training.  The occupations
          available depend mainly on Social Class, although birthplace
          and natural talent (attributes) may open or close some
          doors.  Some vocations (Knight and Herald) are only
          available to high-born individuals; some require exceptional
          natural talent.  Birthplace is also relevant; a person born
          in land-locked Kaldor may have a hard time running away to
          the sea.
        </p>
        <p>
          Determining the chances for the occupation of a random
          individual is hard, since no such census data is available.
          The outcome would largely depend on Social Class, which
          depends on the occupation of one&#8217;s parents.  Some
          children follow the same occupation or choose another at GM
          discretion.  The eldest born survivor, especially if a
          favorite, would be expected to follow the family occupation.
          Later born offspring have more choice, especially if
          unpopular.  As a reference, the occupations a person can
          choose in H&#226;rnic society are listed, with average
          income and years of apprenticeship.

          <em>Guilded Occupations:</em> Wages given are for Bonded
          Masters; room and board may also be provided.  The employer
          would bear the additional cost of providing materials and
          supplies, but tools are owned by the master.  A skilled
          mason-architect building a new castle, or an exquisite sword
          craftsman, could earn fees up to six times higher, but such
          incomes are rare.  Apprentices receive room &#0038; board
          and sometimes get pocket money from generous masters.
          Journeymen receive 30-60% of a master&#8217;s wages,
          depending on experience, plus room and board.  Freemasters
          have variable incomes because demand for their services can
          vary.  See: H&#226;rnPlayer, page 15.

          <em>Unguilded Occupations:</em> Wages given are for average
          experienced workers; others might earn more/less depending

          Occupational rating is on the typical five-star scale.  When
          completing an apprenticeship, a person is assumed to have
          advanced to &#9733;&#9733;&#9733;&#9733; through his
          training.  The occupation of the parent will usually convey
          a &#9733; rating.  Attributes play a role in selecting a
          suitable profession.  There are practical and common sense
          limits.  A warrior with a sufficiently high Aura can
          certainly learn spells, but doing so requires years learning
          the mysteries and ways of magic.

        <h3 id="cleric">Cleric</h3>
        <p>
          People interested in a clerical career must visit a temple
          or abbey to be interviewed by the Master of Acolytes, or
          find a priest to sponsor the application.  An appropriate
          Morality and a minimum ritual knowledge are generally
          required, but a large donation to temple coffers may
          overcome a deficiency in talent.  Acolyte training takes
          seven years.  The church is a popular career for the second
          (or later) sons of nobility, or for devout characters of
          lesser birth.  The complex mysteries of church doctrine are
          described in <em>Religion</em>.
        </p>
        <p>
          Each church has holy scriptures written in a particular
          language and script: Churches teach this language and script
          to all Acolytes.  Three churches perform their ceremonies
          and rituals in a private (secret) language in addition to
          their church language.

          Newly ordained clerics start play knowing some ritual

          taught to clerics.  Clerics may learn other invocations.
          Also see Religion.  Clerics usually complete their training
          with little of material value.  Acolytes are unpaid and the
          simple monastic life they lead in training does not
          encourage the accumulation of worldly goods.  Newly ordained
          clerics typically own a wool robe, linen tunic and hose,
          leather sandals or boots, a dagger or staff, a simple ring
          denoting their status, and a purse of 6-36 pence.

          quality according to a five-star scale.  The best are
          difficult to find and enter.  A high Aura is required, but
          most applicants can improve their chance of acceptance if
          they have the right family connections, sufficient funds to

          When Mavari learn how to attune to their element, they are
          taught to let a small amount of Principle exist within their
          Aura.  Attunement must be done slowly and carefully, and it
          takes months before sufficient Principle can reside within
          the Aura to allow spells to be cast.  Mages refer to this
          Aura-resident Principle as their Foundation.  With time and
          practice, Foundations can be increased in size to
          accommodate Principle from other convocations.  A gifted
          Mavari will sometimes join a convocation in opposition to
          his Sunsign.  This gives him an advantage when learning
          spells of other convocations in the future, although it will
          impede his early career.  A Shek-Pvar Satia-Mavari departs
          from their chantry after five to seven years apprenticeship.
          Masters expect Mavari to spend the majority of their time
          learning spells of their own convocation.

            incomplete leather and are equipped with a spear, shield,
            and a knife or dagger.  Light foot are the fundamental
            troop type, and form the bulk of most standing armies.
          </p>
          <p>
            <em>Medium Foot [MF]</em> Medium Foot have better weapons,
            most likely a spear, shortsword, shield, and better
            armour, perhaps some scale or mail.  They are nearly
            always better trained and more experienced.

            <em>Heavy Foot [HF]</em> The only permanent heavy foot
            found on H&#226;rn are elite High Guard units within the
            dwarven army of Azadmere.  Heavy foot carry heavy weapons
            like a battleaxe and are armoured with mail &#0038; quilt.

            unarmoured horse, or used en masse in battle.
          </p>
          <p>
            <em>Medium Horse [MH]</em> Riders are well-armoured in

          Because of the pervasive military influence of the Azeryan

          throughout Northwestern Lythia.
        </p>
        <p>
          Five enlisted ranks are in general use.  These are rarely
          filled by nobles, who would consider them beneath their
          station.  <em>Molak:</em> the common soldier.  Status and
          remuneration vary according to special skills and unit type.
          <em>Arkalin:</em> commands a manus of five men; himself and
          four Molaks.  <em>Melbrin:</em> commands a decad of ten men;
          himself, one Arkalin, and eight Molaks.  <em>Molarin:</em>
          commands a company of twenty men; himself, one Melbrin, two
          Arkalins, and sixteen Molaks.  A cavalry Molarin commands a
          squadron.  <em>Armolarin:</em> the most senior Molarin in a
          centad.  He is the principal liaison between officers and
          men, and is often the real commander of a Centad.
        </p>
        <p>
          Officers are gentlemen.  A commoner rising to officer rank
          is also invariably knighted.  There is widespread belief
          that leaders must be noble, although there is no law to that
          effect.  Five officer ranks exist.  <em>Hulhurin:</em>
          junior staff officer, and deputy commander of a Centad.  May
          also command an auxiliary company.  <em>Hethrin:</em>
          commander of a Centad, or a Cohort staff officer.
          <em>Kurlin:</em> senior staff officer, and deputy commander
          of a Cohort.  <em>Berheth:</em> commander of a Cohort.
          <em>Tharin:</em> commander of a Legion, which has two or
          more Cohorts.
        </p>
        <p>
          Light horse units have the same ranks as infantry officers,
          except there is no Decad command.  Medium and Heavy horse
          units differ at Manus and Squadron level.
          <em>Chalisir:</em> any trooper in a medium or heavy horse
          unit.  A manus will be commanded by a senior Chalisir.
          <em>Kephiri:</em> commander of a Squadron of medium or heavy
          horse.
        </p>
        <p>
          Most units let individuals enlist at age 16, and discourage
          those over 30.  Interested individuals must contact a unit.
          The recruiting officer will ask about the person&#8217;s
          background, and military experience.  A recommendation from
          someone in the unit might be helpful, and some Knight units
          (including the Khuzdul High Guard) require applicants to be
          noble.

          Having completed four years of service, soldiers may now
          elect to continue their military career or muster-out of the
          army to follow some other occupation.  Guard and legionnaire
          units require a one year contract at the end of which a
          Re-enlistment Incentive may be offered to sign up for
          another twelve months.  Irregular units have less formal
          contracts, most likely just a handshake or an oath, but the
          effect is the same.

          Military wages are traditionally paid quarterly, but are
          listed monthly for comparison with other incomes.
          Considering the danger, wages are low, but armies offer
          various other benefits, and sometimes deliver them.  These
          include food and shelter, and the opportunity to collect
          booty.  The wage table gives monthly base pay.  Elite units
          may get more, although some elite units in which men serve
          for honor may get less.  It is not unusual for a soldier to
          work long stretches followed by long furloughs.  Armies are
          generous with (unpaid) leave in peacetime.  All foot units
          know the ranks Molak, Arkalin, Melbrin, Molarin, and
          Armolarin.  The pay listed is for Molaks, every next rank
          has a pay increase of 1/4 over the previous rank on the
          Molak&#8217;s base.  E.g. a Longbow Melbrin earns a monthly
          108d.  Light Horse units have the ranks Molak, Arkalin,
          Molarin, and Armolarin and progress 96d, 120d, 180d, and
          216d.  Medium and Heavy Horse units only have the ranks of
          Chalasir and Kephiri, of which the Kephiri earn +96d monthly
          over the base pay for Chalasirs.
        </p>
        <p>
          Traditionally, a soldier may keep 2/3 of booty collected,
          giving 1/3 to the next highest rank, who gives 1/3 to the
          next highest rank, and so on.  High ranking officers can get
          very rich with this scheme.  Cash bonuses are sometimes
          given for long, distinguished service, or as a re-enlistment
          incentive.  There is no typical amount, although a bonus
          would rarely exceed a month&#8217;s pay.
        </p>
        <p>
          Standing armies typically offer land grants to soldiers
          after twenty years service.  Monetary pensions are rare, but
          &#8220;half-pay for life &#8221; might be awarded to a
          soldier who has distinguished himself in some way.  When a
          soldier is maimed in the course of duty, he is discharged
          with a lump sum bonus rather than a pension.  The amount is
          two to twelve months pay, depending on the nature of the
          injury and wealth of the unit.  Few armies provide survivor
          benefits.  A bonus of about six month&#8217;s pay might be
          provided to a widow in exceptional cases.  More commonly,
          the comrades of the deceased will make a collection.
        </p>

          A cohort, ideally, consists of two centads of light foot,
          one of medium foot and one of light footbowmen (shortbow or
          longbow).  In addition, there are often auxiliary units,
          such as companies of engineers (sappers), artillery (siege
          engines), light cavalry (scouts), medical, ostlers,
          weaponcrafters, etc.  In practice a Cohort may contain from
          two to six Centads, each consisting of two to eight
          Companies.  The economic realities of manning, equipping,
          and supporting military units have always overwhelmed the
          neat organizational plans of staff officers.  Each centad
          ideally has 100 men, grouped into 5 companies, lead by a
          Hethrin.  Each company consists of 2 decads and each decad
          has 2 manus.
        </p>
        <p>
          Some states, like Azeryan, group their cohorts into legions.
          The ideal Azeryani legion consists of four cohorts plus
          various auxiliary or reserve units attached to the legion
          HQ.  On H&#226;rn, legions exist only in the Thardic
          Republic where they tend to be little more than large
          cohorts.
        </p>
        <p>
          Full strength cavalry cohorts are rare.  It is simply too
          expensive to maintain such units in peacetime.  The cohort
          shown, which exists only in the dreams of Lord Marshals,
          contains one centad of regular light horse, two centads of
          feudal medium horse, and one centad of feudal heavy horse.
          From mid-spring to mid-autumn, one or two squadrons of each
          feudal centad might be manned by knights doing their
          military service.  Other squadrons would be inactive until a
          military emergency arises.  Feudal units might be virtually
          devoid of personnel in winter.  Formally, a squadron
          consists of 10 riders, and is split into two manus.  Most
          cavalry tends to be deployed in small units of squadron or
          centad strength and massed only for battle.  There are, of
          course, exceptions, such as the large bodies of horse
          defending Shorkyne and Trierzon&#8217;s borders.  Imperial
          cavalry tends to be mostly light.  Azeryan, for example,
          uses cavalry in a supporting role (scouts and skirmishers),
          as does Tharda.  This is mostly due to the lack of a feudal
          societal class.  The Azeryani do, however, hire foreign
          knights to serve in some special forces.  Logistical
          problems are different for cavalry units.  Auxiliary forces,
          weaponcrafters, ostlers, transport, engineers, and the like
          are all slower than cavalry, and tend to get left behind.
          Units, even small ones, may have their own &#8220;field
          households &#8221; (messes) in tow.  These too, may
          straggle.

        <p>
          Healing is a widely-practiced art.  Clerics of Peoni have
          considerable medical expertise.  Nearly all lay-folk,
          especially in rural areas, have some understanding of herbal
          remedies.  Most warriors know emergency treatments for
          battlefield wounds.
        </p>
        <p>
          Those who practice the healing arts full-time generally
          belong to the Society of Physicians, a loosely-organized
          guild.  The Society does not care much about preserving its
          monopoly, and makes little attempt to maintain standards.
          Some masters are incompetent quacks, while others are
          highly-skilled surgeons.  However, a physician who maims or
          kills too many patients will soon encounter difficulties
          from outraged friends and relatives.
        </p>
        <p>
          Master physicians may take on as many apprentices as they
          wish.  There are no journeymen in the Society, nor bonded
          masters in the normal sense; masters may take employment as
          they see fit.  Many masters are associated with the church
          of Peoni, and some dabble in the arcane arts.  Most
          physicians confine themselves to the treatment of minor
          ailments.  Fees vary dramatically, sometimes according to
          the skill brought to bear, but mostly according to
          reputation.  Fees typically range from 3d for fairly basic
          first aid to 240d for major surgery.  Medicines, provided by
          the Apothecaries&#8217; Guild, and hospital care (rare) can
          double or triple fees.
        </p>
        <p>
          When people get sick or wounded, they are advised to get the
          best first aid available, and then seek someone with a
          decent Physician Mastery as soon as possible.  Carrying a
          good supply of bandages and herbal remedies is always a good
          idea.  H&#226;rnic doctors are far more competent than their
          medieval Terran colleagues.  They know, for example,
          it&#8217;s a good idea to keep open wounds and surgical
          instruments as clean as possible, although they do not know
          why.  One theory has to do with fiery, invisible elementals
          which can be driven off with hot water.  If no doctor is
          available any friend can administer treatment and
          self-treatment is always possible (modified by Will at GM
          discretion).

            <em>Amputate:</em> Surgical amputation is the only
            treatment for Grievous Frost and may be used to halt
            infection spreading.  The afflicted body part is removed,
            but a new Serious or Grievous wound is created according

          </p>
          <p>
            <em>Clean and Dress:</em> Takes a few minutes and requires

        <h1 id="psi">Psionics</h1>
        <p>
          Psionic talents are native, psychic abilities some people
          possess, but may be unaware of.  Since it requires years of
          practice to properly employ Psionic talents, they are within
          the sphere of the Guild of Arcane Lore.  Those endowed may
          notice some of the odd effects produced by their latent
          Psionic abilities to &#9733; (one star on the five-star
          scale).  Some learn of their ability when another person
          with a developed talent is able to sense and inform them of
          its presence.  Some talents are never discovered and remain
          dormant forever.  Individuals who wish to became a mage are
          more likely to be accepted as an apprentice if they have an
          active Psionic talent.
        </p>
        <p>
          Psionic Talents at &#9733; are dormant.  Anyone with a
          dormant talent is unaware of its existence.  No conscious
          development of dormant talents is possible.  However,
          exposure to powerful Psionic events or artifacts may
          stimulate a dormant talent.  Once the talent exceeds
          &#9733;, it becomes known to the person possessing it.  A
          dormant talent may reveal its nature with Psionic Episodes.
          In later parts of the dormant stage, frequent Psionic
          episodes can lead to apprehensions that the person is
          insane, and may cause well-meaning observers to attempt
          cures or confinement.  This can be awkward when the person
          does not know the cause of the problem.
        </p>
        <p>
          Once a talent develops past the dormant stage, it may be
          developed more or less normally.  The individual must
          meditate (not sleep!) for at least 8 hours of a day to gain
          new insights.  Anyone with an active Psionic talent can
          attempt to use it at anytime, provided the person is
          conscious.  Using Psionic talents is tiring, regardless,
          whether or not the attempt is successful.  Fatigue can also
          be accumulated after a Psionic episode.  Particularly
          stressing invocations may cause the invoker to fall
          unconscious and also suffers Psionic Blindness, the complete
          inability to use any Psionic talent, for several hours.
          Sometimes unpredictable and/or unanticipated results may
          occur when invoking a Psionic talent.  Possibilities for
          misfires are given in the talent descriptions.  Psionic
          episodes occur randomly but are more likely, when a talent
          is used often or for extended periods of time.
        </p>
        <p>
          Medium, Prescience, and Sensitivity are talents which may be
          stimulated by appropriate phenomena, which is called passive
          triggering.  Medium may be triggered by the presence of
          ethereals, Prescience by imminent danger, and Sensitivity by
          a Psionic or magical residue/effect.  If the stimulus is
          weak, the person is less likely to be alerted.  When passive
          triggering occurs, the owner is given minimal information.
          If the person wants more information, the talent must be
          used actively (with fatigue being a consequence).
        </p>
        <p>
          Two people with the same Psionic talent may wish to pool
          their efforts in invoking the talent.  This may be done if
          skin contact is established by grasping hands, etc. and skin
          contact is maintained during the time spent invoking the
          talent.  Under unknown circumstances ritual procedure may
          need to be followed in order to form the necessary fusion
          between invokers.  This will become known to the affected
          invokers instinctively.
        </p>
        <p>
          The following talents are known by the guild.  No
          percentages are given, because talents are too rare to
          gather sufficient statistics.  While Psionics are more
          instinctive than spells, concepts such as Spellfire Timing,
          Modeling, Detection, Noise, and Foci, all have application.

            invoker&#8217;s presence.
          </p>
          <p>
            <em>Misfire:</em> The invoker, or a random person/animal

          </p>
        </div>
        <p>
          A Psionic talent to influence the mind of another person
          (victim).  The usual effect is to paralyze the victim in
          place for a limited period of time.  In order to invoke the
          talent successfully, eye contact between the invoker and the
          victim is necessary, but only for a momentary glance.  The
          maximum distance at which effective eye contact can occur is
          approximately 10 yards.  The effect remains in place until
          the attacker stops gazing at the victim.

        <h5 id="psi-cla">Clairvoyance</h5>
        <div class="standard">

            <em>Psionic Episodes:</em> Vivid dreams of faraway people
            and things.  Dizziness, disorientation, confusion,
            headaches, sleepwalking, blurred vision, or mirage-like
            hallucinations can also occur.
          </p>
          <p>
            <em>Misfire:</em> False or random information is given to
            the clairvoyant.  Sometimes, severe headaches that cause
            temporary blindness occurs.
          </p>
        </div>
        <p>
          The ability to visualize events currently occurring at a
          remote location.  A target may sense the attention of a
          clairvoyant.  The psychic enters a trance and after the
          first minute gets a clear image of some object, person, or
          location that he is familiar with.  The image may be moving
          and is of the current state.  Sensory perception is normal
          but with narrow focus on the object.  Clairvoyance may be
          used in either of two ways: <em>Near:</em> The clairvoyant
          enters a trance to transfer their point of perception to a
          location.  The location must be familiar to the clairvoyant.
          <em>Far:</em> The clairvoyant enters a trance sand attempts
          to focus on a specific, remote person or object whose
          location may not be known.  The clairvoyant does this by
          visualizing the person&#8217;s face (or by describing the
          object).  There are no range restrictions, but there is also
          no chance to listen or smell.

        <div class="standard">
          <p>
            <em>Psionic Episodes:</em> Sleepwalking, dreams of

            Jamais vu, lightheadedness, peculiar shivers, dizziness,
            or a feeling of being watched.
          </p>
          <p>
            <em>Misfire:</em> Extreme weakness, dizziness,

        <p>
          The ability to detach the ethereal spirit from the body,
          which is left in a state of metabolic suspension.  The
          disembodied spirit is referred to as an astral entity.
          Information about the abilities of astral entities is in
          Religion.  It is difficult to remain in a disembodied state
          for long.  The talent lasts for several minutes, after which
          the astral entity instantly returns to its body (even if it
          does not want to return).  If the body is vacant when the
          astral entity returns, it reunites with its body and a Shock
          Roll is then made.  If the body has been occupied by another
          ethereal while the astral entity was away, Mental Conflict
          occurs.  Disembodiment is achieved by making one&#8217;s
          body very relaxed (somewhat similar to how one falls
          asleep).  The time needed to invoke the talent is one
          minute.

          <p>
            <em>Restoration:</em> An attempt to remove fatigue.
            Remove fatigue from the victim at a seemingly random rate.
            The fatigue is accrued by the talent user at the normal
            rate.

          <p>
            <em>Bloodloss:</em> An attempt to clot a single bleeding
            wound.
          </p>
          <p>
            <em>Heal:</em> An attempt to increase the healing rate of
            one identified ailment or wound.  No fatigue is
            accumulated, but it requires constant attention as a
            physician would need.

          Sometimes called &#8220;the evil eye, &#8221; Hex is the
          ability to curse a victim, causing them to have bad luck.
          If the invoker has a part of the victim (nail parings, lock
          of hair, etc.) increase Mastery.  Such items cannot be used
          more than once.  At the time the talent is invoked, the
          maximum distance between the invoker and the intended victim
          depends on whether the invoker has a part of the victim.  If
          a part is available, the maximum distance is a league.  If a
          part is unavailable, the maximum distance is line of sight.
          The psychic enters a trance and after the first minute
          reduces the victims rolls by his talent skill level.  The
          person may be moving.

          Medium is subject to passive triggering.  The talent may be
          used in one of three ways.  Each requires a trance and
          accumulates fatigue.
        </p>
        <div class="explain">

          <p>
            <em>Summon:</em> An attempt to summon an ethereal
            currently perceived by the invoker, or whose true name is
            known.  This results in a Mental Conflict.  Knowing the
            &#8220;true name &#8221; is beneficial to the talent user.

            won.  Some ethereals are beyond control.  With a win, the
            ethereal may be commanded to perform a simple task such as
            answer a yes/no question truthfully within its knowledge,
            or dispossess a body.

          The invoker enters a trance for 10 seconds and if
          successful, creates a spherical Psionic field, centered on
          the invoker&#8217;s head.  The field lasts for several
          minutes, but may be dissolved instantly by its creator.  The
          field requires great concentration to maintain; the invoker
          is in a trance and limited to simple activities, like
          walking.  Any magic or Psionics entering or within the field

          be symbolic in nature.  Folklore may be used to interpret
          the vision.  Some clerics and divinators specialize in
          interpretation of prescient visions.  There are two active
          forms:
        </p>
        <div class="explain">
          <p>
            <em>Prescient Vision:</em> The invoker specifies the
            subject of inquiry.  The invoker enters a trance for one
            hour, during which a prescient vision occurs concerning
            the subject.  Mastery is reduced if the subject is hidden
            by magic, etc.  Normally, the invoker lacks control over
            the vision, but with &#9733;&#9733;&#9733;&#9733; or
            above, it is possible to direct the inquiry somewhat.
            Prescience can only reveal likely future events; the
            future may be altered.  The trance does not cause fatigue.
          </p>
          <p>
            <em>Sense of Danger:</em> An attempt to assess danger in a
            specific location.  The invoker enters a trance for about
            a minute.  If successful, this gives a vague feeling of
            danger if there are traps or lurking dangers within an
            area that could reasonably be reached/accessed within the
            time frame the trance lasts.  This trance causes fatigue.

        </div>
        <p>
          The ability to divine information about persons by touching
          an object with which they have been in contact.  Psychometry
          requires the invoker to hold the object and enter a trance
          for a few minutes.  Psychometry is most often used to divine
          the age or history of an object, the identity of the
          object&#8217;s maker or owners, magical/divine powers, etc.
          Another use is to determine a person&#8217;s location.
        </p>
        <p>
          Psychometry can never be used to divine the future.  It
          works best when queries concern the present or recent past.
          Mastery is reduced for inquiries in the distant past, or if
          knowledge of the object is magically or divinely hidden.
          The longer the vision lasts, the more information is
          obtained.  A reasonable minimum is 5 minutes.  (Accrues
          fatigue.)

          Raises the temperature of a combustible, inanimate object to

          the fire takes a long as it takes to throw an imaginary fire
          to the target.  It takes a bit longer when the object is
          chilled or wet.  Once the object begins to burn, the invoker
          has no control over the fire.  The talent may be used to
          warm objects to a desired temperature less than flash point,
          but bad results may cause ignition.  The talent has no

          of any such effects.  Maximum range at which a
          spell/artifact/talent can be detected is usually 5 yards.
          Sensitivity can also be used to attune to magical artifacts
          or effects.  Once attunement is achieved, it usually lasts
          as long as the invoker stays within range of the

          The power to transmit thoughts or emotions to the mind of
          another individual (target).  Transmission range is skill
          level in km,, but clarity diminishes with range.  The talent
          is invoked by concentrating on the thought/emotion for one

          attempted; the target&#8217;s location does not need to be
          known by the invoker.  Someone who receives an emotion will
          feel it - this can have an interesting effect.  If a person
          with the Sensitivity talent is near the target or the

          things on the way.  Travel is ethereal, instantaneous, and
          takes 5 minutes of being absent minded (to the observer).
          The talent is fairly common among the older bloodlines of
          the Sindarin, but otherwise rare.  The invoker does not
          necessarily know where the destination will be, although it
          is always a similar environment.  Barasi Points are natural
          portals between worlds.  Dozens exist throughout Kethira,

          high concentration.  The environment at each end of a Barasi

          The Psionic ability to shapechange.  The target form is

          physical attributes of the target form, but retains his own

          A few scholars may argue that the gods are figments of the
          imaginations of men, but most Lythians believe implicitly in
          their existence.  H&#226;rnic society is pregnant with
          divine superstition.  In addition to the ten major deities,
          hundreds of lesser semi-divine entities are worshiped by
          Lythians.  The powers of the deities, if not infinite, are
          beyond the compass of mortals.  Demigods, on the other hand,
          are closer to humankind; their imperfections and weaknesses,
          their attitudes and objectives, may at least be comprehended
          by mortals.  Demigods are of two types: those who serve one
          of the ten great deities by choice or compulsion, and those
          who serve no master.  They vary in strength and attitude.
          Some demigods are confined to specific regions by greater
          beings or principles, some are associated with particular
          peoples or institutions, and some are semi-legendary mortal
          heroes.  A demon is simply a demigod one believes to be

        <p>
          Each of the ten major deities have mortal adherents who have
          created religious institutions to regulate and foster their
          version of the truth.  The organization of churches vary
          greatly.  Each is detailed in the separate deity articles,
          but a few generalities can be made.  All churches have a
          clergy and laity although a few, like the Church of Naveh,
          almost totally ignore the latter.  Some laity may be
          extremely pious, but they will not be taught the higher
          rituals of the church.  The clergy are the priests and
          priestesses, those who organize and administer the temples
          and devote their lives to serving the deity.  Although often
          simple folk by birth, clerics enjoy a privileged social
          status between that of guildsmen and the nobility.  All
          churches of the ten major deities have ceremonial levels of
          knowledge called Circles of Command.  Most churches have
          seven Circles, although those without Pontiffs have only
          six.  The table below indicates offices a member of that
          Circle is qualified to hold.
        </p>
        <include id="$Ritual-circ"/>
        <p>
          Those baptized in a faith are automatically I. Circle.
          Those entering the church as a career are admitted to the
          II. Circle.  Clerics are admitted to the III. Circle when
          they are ordained.  Admission to higher Circles require
          approval of at least three existing members of the desired
          Circle.  This may occur soon, or it can be delayed by years
          of political intrigue.  Churches appoint members of the
          clergy to permanent or temporary offices.  All promotions
          are controlled by those with higher office, except the
          highest office is usually the result of election by peers.
          In some churches the offices of Archbishop, Primate, and
          Pontiff are (effectively) restricted to clerics of noble
          blood.  People may apply for appointment to any vacant
          church office for which their current Circle qualifies them.
          Appointments are handled solely at GM discretion; a
          candidate&#8217;s Intrigue and Social Class are always
          significant.
        </p>
        <p>
          Most churches contain one or more clerical orders and most
          clerics are members of a specific order.  The lay followers
          of a deity are not required to join any particular clerical
          order, but those with martial skill often belong to fighting
          orders which are sponsored by various clerical orders.
          Clerical and fighting orders have their own hierarchies.
          Morality is a crucial attribute for clerics.  Although
          church officials may be unaware of a person&#8217;s true
          Morality, deities are not so easily fooled.  Clerics
          entering a church for which their Morality is inappropriate
          are unlikely to prosper, or even live very long.  Circles
          are ceremonial ranks, whereas offices are political ranks.
          Higher circles are evidence of a certain level of knowledge,
          but in no way guarantee promotion to higher office.  A High
          Priest is a member of at least the IV. Circle, but most
          members of the IV. Circle are simple priests.  Although
          rare, there have been cases where a VII. Circle pontiff
          retired to end his days as a simple abbey priest.
        </p>
        <p>
          Legally recognized churches have the right to hold their own
          courts and administer justice for a variety of religious
          crimes, including blasphemy, heresy, and witchcraft.  Temple
          courts often use trial by ordeal to determine guilt or
          innocence.  The penalties handed out vary from one church to
          another; Peonian courts rarely inflict permanent harm on
          offenders, but Agrikan courts are fond of burning at the
          stake.  Temple courts must obtain secular consent to any
          death penalties, a formality often ignored by some churches.
          For more information, see H&#226;rnPlayer.
        </p>
        <p>
          There is corruption in every church.  Most churches argue
          that their clerics are infallible, but corrupt ones will be
          punished in the afterlife.  This may be of small comfort to
          a cleric who is roasted alive on false charges of heresy.
          The piety and ritual rules allow clerics to perform ritual
          invocations without piety, although pious priests can do
          them better.
        </p>
        <p>
          The fragmentation of the churches resulting from pantheism
          weakens their universal influence, but their power in
          specific regions, or among some economic groups is
          significant.  The churches of Larani and Peoni dominate in
          the kingdoms of Chybisa, Kaldor, Kanday, and Melderyn.  The
          church of Agrik is prominent in the Kingdom of Rethem.
          Adherents of Save-K&#8217;nor tend to be scholars with
          influence throughout H&#226;rn, on Melderyn in particular.
          Sarajinism is the dominant faith of the Ivinian conquerors
          of Orbaal, while Ilvir holds some sway among their subject
          Jarin.  Siem is primarily worshiped by the Khuzdul and
          Sindarin, although each race tends to focus their faith
          through one of two demigod servants.  Halea has support from
          merchants and guildsmen in all states, but is most dominant
          in the Thardic Republic.  The churches of Morgath and Naveh
          have few adherents; both are proscribed and covert
          throughout most of H&#226;rn, except the Church of Morgathm
          which has enormous influence in Golotha, the principal city
          of Rethem.

        <h3 id="piety">Piety</h3>
        <p>
          Piety is a unit of favor with a deity and religious zeal.
          People accrue Piety by performing actions publicly
          beneficial to their deity.  They expend them by publicly
          committing a sin.  Piety may also be used to increase the
          Mastery of any skill of Prayer.  Piety is dedicated to a
          single deity.  Individuals can, if they wish, maintain
          separate Piety totals for two or more deities.  Multiple
          worship is rare, especially among clerics.  Most folk fear
          this will compromise the passage of their soul when they
          die.  Remember that a major sin to Larani, might be viewed
          by Agrik as commendable.  Also remember that the viewpoint
          of a church and its deity may differ; an overzealous or
          corrupt priest might declare an action to be a major sin,
          but a deity might not agree.  Adherents of churches that
          hear confessions may be able to avoid some penalties, but
          penances are often imposed, especially on ordained clerics.
          Some people are said to have Divine Grace.  Divine Grace has
          the following important effects:
        </p>
        <p>
          Individuals with Divine Grace are deemed worthy of divine
          aid, and individuals without Divine Grace are unworthy.
          Hence, a call for divine intervention is more likely to
          succeed for those with Divine Grace.  Invocations that heal
          injuries, cure diseases, remove curses, etc., have a Special
          Bonus if the subject has Divine Grace.  A person without
          Divine Grace will have difficulty convincing a deity to
          claim his spirit when he dies, forcing it to wonder the
          worlds as a shade, or to negotiate with another deity for
          acceptance.
        </p>
        <div class="explain">
          <p>
            <em>Prayer.</em> One uninterrupted hour of prayer and/or
            meditation in an appropriate temple or on other
            consecrated ground.
          </p>
          <p>
            <em>Fasting.</em> A full day (24 hours) of fasting, which
            cannot include any other activity except prayer, sleep,
            etc.  Note: starving is not fasting; individuals must make
            a conscious decision not to eat when food is available.
          </p>
          <p>
            <em>Confession.</em> The churches of Halea, Larani,
            Morgath, Naveh, Peoni, and Save-K&#8217;nor hear
            confessions.  Only confessions of significant guilt are
            worthy of piety.  Confessions must be made to an ordained
            cleric who (80% chance) may demand a penance.
          </p>
          <p>
            <em>Daily Mass.</em> Attendance at the daily church
            service held by most temples.  Daily Mass is generally
            held in the early evening and lasts one or more hours.
            Services may be attended by anyone.
          </p>
          <p>
            <em>Monthly Low Mass.</em> Most churches hold a special
            monthly Low Mass for the laity.  The day varies by church.
            There is no Daily Mass on this day.
          </p>
          <p>
            <em>Monthly High Mass.</em> Most churches hold a monthly
            High Mass which may be attended only by the clergy.  The
            day varies by church; most have one day a month they
            consider more holy than any other.
          </p>
          <p>
            <em>Feast Mass.</em> Held yearly on the principal holy
            day, this mass often lasts four hours.  It is usually
            followed by second service open only to clerics.  There is
            no High Mass or Daily Mass on this day.  A &#8220;feaster
            &#8221; is a name given to adherents who attend only the
            Feast Mass - it is a derogatory term.
          </p>
          <p>
            <em>Temple Service.</em> Some people perform a minor task
            for the temple, such as cleaning out the storerooms or
            latrines.  The service usually takes a couple of days to
            perform.  Piety accrual is on completion and may vary with
            the difficulty (or unpleasantness) of the task.
          </p>
          <p>
            <em>Donation/Sacrifice.</em> People may make donations to
            temples or sacrifices to their deity.  A sacrifice must be
            appropriate to the deity.  Siem, for example, would cast
            out anyone who sacrificed a life; Morgath would be very
            pleased.  Something of high value to the individual will
            probably be more favored by the deity.
          </p>
          <p>
            <em>Quest.</em> Adherent agrees to perform a task in the
            service of a church and/or deity.  Individuals who
            willingly abandon the task before completion lose piety.
          </p>
          <p>
            <em>Pilgrimage.</em> Adherent undertakes a journey to a
            holy site of the deity.  Piety granted reflects the
            distance and danger involved.  Because the ways of deities
            are incomprehensible to mortals, the piety for any act may
            seem random.

        <h3 id="intervent">Divine Intervention</h3>
        <p>
          The motives of the gods vary.  The kind of universe desired
          by Morgath, the Lord of Chaos, is different from that wanted
          by Peoni, the gentle patron of healing.  The problem all ten
          gods face is that they cannot destroy each other without
          risking all their destructions.  Hence, the Concordat limits
          the actions that may be taken.  Conflict between the gods is
          now more or less confined to the mortal and semi-mortal
          planes of Kethira and Yashain.  Siem has withdrawn to the
          Blessed Realm, and Ilvir broods alone at Araka-Kalai.
          Halea, Naveh, Save-K&#8217;nor, and Sarajin have established
          their neutrality, although each favors varying degrees of
          order and chaos.  Peoni is effectively a non-combatant.
          Larani stands, essentially alone, against Morgath and Agrik.
          These two evil deities have not formed an alliance, but it
          is their works that Larani tries to undo.  These divisions
          are not simply based on morality.  The quasi-war between
          Larani and the dark pair is more complex than a simple epic.
          Agrik, and especially Morgath, represent a degree of chaos,
          a breaking down of order that would greatly change the
          worlds.  To prevent total chaos, and enforce the Concordat,
          the other gods support Larani to survive, but not to win.
          To prevent all-out war, there is a Concordat limiting the
          interference of deities in the affairs of lesser
          beings. Although mortals cannot know the truth or nature of
          these limits, the following principles, hotly debated by
          theologians, have evolved to justify the limitations of the
          gods.  These principles are not always followed precisely by
          the deities, are often violated by demigods, and certainly
          do not apply to mortal adherents.
        </p>
        <div class="explain">
          <p>
            <em>Principle of Ineluctability:</em> A mortal mind cannot

          </p>
          <p>
            <em>Principle of Transpotence:</em> Since there is more
            than one deity, and lethal conflict between them is
            possible, the deities are not omnipotent.
          </p>
          <p>
            <em>Principle of Preservation:</em> The gods cannot

          <p>
            <em>Principle of Reaction:</em> Every intervention can be

            <em>Principle of Proxy:</em> The gods cannot act directly
            against one another, only through the conflict of demigods
            and mortals.
          </p>
          <p>
            <em>Principle of Faith:</em> The gods are reluctant to

            possible to explain their acts.
          </p>
          <p>
            <em>Principle of Interference:</em> Deities do not take
            direct action against the adherents of another deity.
            Deities rather preserve their own adherents than to harm
            those of another deity.

            <em>Principle of Piety:</em> Intervention cannot occur

          Divine Intervention is an attempt to enlist the aid of a
          deity to perform a miracle.  Interventions are implemented
          by gods; if they choose to respond at all, they decide what
          to do.  A deity may be open to suggestion, but will not take
          kindly to demands.  A person may call for Divine
          Intervention at any time.  A call for intervention may be
          anything from, &#8220;Please help us out of this terrible
          mess &#8221; to &#8220;Please tell me the contents of this
          box. &#8221; There are no limits, just consequences.  An
          individual calling for Divine Intervention must have at
          least &#9733; Piety for that deity.  Each deity has a base
          chance of 20% to intervene.  (These statistics are collected
          by the individual churches and are <em>highly</em>
          subjective and significantly favor their own deity.  Still,
          the average across all ten major deities is presented.  The
          data should therefore be taken with a pound of salt.)  Piety
          from two or more individuals may be combined; each may make
          a separate call.  Calls that are trivial or unethical (for
          that deity) are always unworthy.  Conversely, a call to do
          something the deity would probably want anyway is more
          likely to succeed and worthy.  Note: Ritual skill plays no
          part in Divine Intervention.  A pious layman has more chance
          of Divine Intervention than an impious cleric of high
          ritual.  Deities are averse to leaving direct evidence of
          their actions or even of their existence.  When a deity
          intervenes, it is generally impossible to prove an
          intervention has actually occurred.  Virtually any
          intervention can be explained away as just as coincidence,
          the normal workings of nature, etc.
        </p>
        <p>
          If the call for intervention succeeds, a 60% chance is
          estimated for the deity to impose conditions for the aid.
          The caller is given a task to fulfill in exchange for the
          intervention.  Such tasks vary from minor services that must
          be undertaken within a year.  Any condition and
          non-compliance penalty depend on the deity, the importance
          of the intervention, and so on.  Refusal to fulfill a
          Condition is unwise.
        </p>
        <p>
          If the call for intervention fails, a 20% chance is
          estimated to see if the deity exacts some kind of
          Retribution on the caller.  If a retribution occurs the
          deity not only fails to help, but also inflicts some curse
          or penance.
        </p>
        <p>
          A call to a demigod increases the chance of Intervention by
          10, but also increases the chance of Conditions by 20, or
          the chance of Retribution by 10.  Individuals may pray in
          the hope of gaining the favor of their deity for any
          endeavor.  Prayers take between one second and one minute
          usually.  The effect is to increase the Mastery in some
          skill by a few points.  Success varies with time and piety
          involved.

        <h3 id="ethereals">Ethereals</h3>
        <p>
          Between this world (Kethira) and the next (Yashain) stands a
          shadowy half-world known by many names, but most often as
          the Astral Plane or the Spirit World.  Ethereals are
          spiritual entities, capable of existing on this Astral
          Plane, and moving between it and Kethira or Yashain.
          Kethira, Yashain, and the Astral Plane all exist in the same
          or nearby physical space.  Passing through solid objects by
          an Ethereal is called &#8220;frooshing. &#8221; For many
          ethereals, this is unpleasant and/or tiring.  A corporeal
          creature &#8220;frooshed &#8221; by an ethereal usually
          experiences an eerie, shivering sensation.
        </p>
        <div class="explain">
          <p>
            <em>Astrals.</em> An astral is a disembodied spirit,
            typically created by the use of the Disembodiment Psionic
            talent or the Transcendence ritual invocation.  An astral
            maintains strong empathy with its own body because it must
            leave at least a portion of its Aura behind to avoid
            death.  Because of this link, an astral entity always
            knows the distance and direction to its native body, and
            is always aware of any in the status of that body.  A
            vacated body is comatose in a state of metabolic
            suspension.  The body is subject to normal physical injury
            and can die during the absence of its astral.  Should this
            occur, the resident and astral portions of Aura will
            immediately dissolute and reform as one entity in double
            the normal time.  An astral may return and repossess its
            own (living) body without difficulty, but fatigue is
            accumulated in the ethereal state.  An astral may also
            return to find its body has been possessed by an alien
            spirit.
          </p>
          <p>
            <em>Shades (Ghosts).</em> A shade is created when: The
            physical body of an astral traveler diesx; a person dies
            without Divine Grace and the spirit is unclaimed by any of
            the gods; a person dies in circumstances which require a
            great wrong to be righted before the spirit can rest.  A
            shade may wander the world(s), but most often haunts the
            scene of its death until the great wrong is righted, or
            they are admitted to an afterlife by one of the gods.
          </p>
          <p>
            <em>Natural Ethereals.</em> These are entities whose
            natural state is ethereal.  They originate on the Astral
            Plane, most often by powerful sorcery or divine will, but
            may have a physical form on some other plane.  Divine and
            semi-divine entities are natural ethereals, as are most
            elementals.  Some entities are able to de-materialize
            their physical bodies and become entirely ethereal by an
            act of will, or by arcane means.  De-materialization has
            the advantage of avoiding the risks of leaving a body
            behind while the spirit travels.  This ability is evidence
            for the view, held by many scholars, that the mortal body
            is simply a convenient physical manifestation of the
            immortal Aura.  This theory, if true, means that all
            creatures are really natural ethereals because their
            immortal state is ethereal.
          </p>
        </div>
        <p>
          Although usually referred to in the singular, the Astral
          Plane is really an almost infinite number of shifting and
          overlapping planes.  Although movement between astral planes
          is almost instantaneous, only divine entities can hope to
          navigate this ethereal maze with any degree of speed or
          accuracy.
        </p>
        <p>
          Ethereals have no physical attributes and cannot see, hear,
          smell, touch, or taste things in a physical sense.  They
          possess only non-physical attributes and abilities,
          including spells and invocations.  Ethereals have the
          Psionic talents of Telepathy and Sensitivity.  They are able
          to directly perceive and communicate with each other, and
          with a corporeal entity bearing these talents.  Their
          sensitivity to Aura also allows them to view all living
          things as a hazy image, day or night.  When moving on the
          same plane, astrals and shades travel as a fast runner would
          and pass through solid objects at will - which is fortunate
          since they cannot see any Aura-less objects.  Natural
          ethereals, especially if winged, can generally move faster
          than this.
        </p>
        <p>
          Ethereals are not subject to physical fatigue, but may
          accrue mental fatigue by using spells or Psionic talents.
          An ethereal may only use talents or spells which do not
          involve physical action on its part.  All Masteries while
          disembodied are subject to fatigue.  Ethereals cannot be
          destroyed.  They are immune to injury except when inflicted
          by enchanted weapons, magic, Psionic talents, or divine
          intervention.  If subjected to esoteric harm, injury is
          translated into fatigue.  Ethereals cannot recover fatigue
          except by dissolution.  Dissolution is the scattering of an
          ethereal&#8217;s &#8220;substance. &#8221; It reforms in
          several hours at the location of the ethereal&#8217;s
          physical body (if it has one), otherwise in a random
          location or plane.  When the process is complete, the
          ethereal regains consciousness and has no fatigue.
        </p>
        <p>
          The natural state of ethereals is invisible.  They can
          become translucent at will, but doing so accrues normal
          Fatigue per minute.  This accumulation of fatigue does not
          by itself cause dissolution, but will increase the
          ethereal&#8217;s susceptibility to dissolution.  An ethereal
          may possess a live body by winning a mental conflict with
          the resident Aura.  Possession is easier if part of the
          native Aura is absent as an astral.  A possessed body
          acquires the personality attributes of the invading spirit,
          while physical attributes are unchanged.  All disembodied
          inidviduals have Telepathy and Sensitivity Psionic talents
          during their ethereal state.  These talents are dormant in
          all creatures with Aura.  Kethira, Yashain, and the Astral
          Planes all exist in the same or nearby physical space.
          Movement between these planes is almost instantaneous,
          assuming the traveler knows the paths to take which is never
          easy given the ever-shifting nature of the Astral planes.
          An ethereal move applies only to movement on the same plane.
          The risk of having a stranger establish squatter&#8217;s
          rights in the &#8220;temple of one&#8217;s body &#8221; is
          one of the greater hazards of astral travel.  From an
          astral&#8217;s perspective, this is akin to breaking into
          someone&#8217;s house, eating the food, drinking the wine,
          trying on the clothes, beating the servants, and bedding the
          spouse.  A vanquished native spirit may attempt to regain
          its own body with a new Mental Conflict after the normal
          period of Dissolution.  An ongoing struggle between the
          invading and native spirit may cause further personality
          switches.  Ethereals may also possess the body of a recently
          dead creature, thus creating a Zombie.

        <p>
          Each person has a soul, the non-physical portion of the
          person.  When the body dies, the soul journeys to its
          afterlife.  Most people commit their soul to one god who
          takes possession of the soul upon death.  Those who die
          godless, or out of Divine Grace with their god, embark on a
          Death Journey unless saved by a funeral rite.  All clerics
          are taught Passage of the Soul, a funeral ritual to help a
          soul make a swift journey to its afterlife.  Although
          funerals vary from church to church and from region to
          region, the basic pattern is the same; a priest of shaman
          performs the ritual to get the attention of the god.  Then
          the priest orchestrates a prayer (often sung) to confer a
          state of Divine Grace upon the deceased by gathering Piety
          from the attendees.  Those who do not attain sufficient
          piety for Divine Grace are on their own as they make the
          Death-Journey.

          The Death-Journey can be long and fraught with peril,
          depending upon how far a person is out of Divine Grace and
          is a series of encounters which continue until the unclaimed
          soul acquires sufficient piety for Divine Grace or until it
          is captured and taken to a deity.  Each encounter
          automatically starts hostile, although it need not end that
          way, and a character might even gain an ally to escort him
          on his Death-Journey.  Use the Mental Conflict rules to
          resolve encounters along the Death-Journey.  If the
          individual defeats an ethereal of the same species, it can
          take possession of the physical body (if any) and end the

        <p>
          Spells and ritual invocations should never be confused.
          Clerics seek to draw the deity&#8217;s attention by
          performing a ritual, and encourage intervention by limiting
          the call to a specific effect but, ultimately, they depend
          on their deity to act.  Spellcasting, on the other hand,
          involves powers released by a mage from the fundament of
          Kelestia and requires no divine intervention.  Mages are
          generally offended by any suggestion that a spell is
          miraculous.  Conversely, any claim that a ritual invocation
          is a spell would be construed by most clerics as an
          admission of blasphemy.
        </p>
        <p>
          Ritual is a skill which reflects an individual&#8217;s
          knowledge of church dogma, holy scriptures, chants, songs,
          and mysteries.  There is a separate Ritual Skill for each
          deity.  It is used by clerics for performing ritual
          invocations.  Individuals may, theoretically, have Ritual
          for two or more deities.  Learning rituals assumes the
          individual in question has received some basic instruction
          in the church mysteries and been baptized into the faith.
          Ritual Mastery can only be improved by learning new
          invocations, reading Holy Tomes, or performing an invocation
          in an adverse situation or in ritual church duty.
        </p>
        <p>
          Ritual invocations are ceremonies that &#8220;encourage
          &#8221; a deity to intervene with a miracle.  They
          originated as a means for clerics to impress their laity or
          potential converts.  These uses are still practiced, but
          many invocations work equally well (often better) to subdue
          those who oppose a cleric&#8217;s deity.  Such use is
          tacitly approved by all churches, since the proxy wars of
          mortals is an acceptable method of conflict among deities.
          Theoretically, anyone may learn the rituals of any Circle,
          but most churches will teach them only to ordained priests.
          The rituals were once closely associated with a specific
          circle, higher rituals being the exclusive knowledge of
          higher circles.  They are still classified in this way, but
          &#8220;leakage &#8221; of knowledge over the centuries has
          eroded this restriction.  Today, the invocations of any
          Circle can be taught to any ordained priest.
        </p>
        <p>
          People may perform any invocation they know.  Invocations
          can be learned in one of three ways: from a mentor, from
          holy scriptures, or by divine revelation.
        </p>
        <div class="explain">
          <p>
            <em>Mentor training.</em> Most invocations are learned
            from another cleric who knows it.  Both the student and
            mentor must be fluent (&#9733;&#9733;&#9733;) in a shared
            language.
          </p>
          <p>
            <em>Holy Scriptures.</em> There are a wide variety of holy
            writings, parables, songs, poems, and teachings that can
            be thought of as Holy Scriptures.  Church archives are
            filled with such written works and clerics consult them to
            expand their knowledge of dogma and ritual.  Invocations
            can be learned from Holy Scriptures if they are written in
            a known language and script, or a reliable translator must
            be available.
          </p>
          <p>
            <em>Divine Revelation.</em> In rare cases, a deity may
            wish to provide knowledge of an invocation to any
            adherent, perhaps even a lay adherent.  Such revelations
            are handled at GM discretion, but are only likely to occur
            if an individual succeeds on a Divine Intervention roll.
          </p>
        </div>
        <p>
          To learn an invocation, a person must spend 5 days per
          Circle.  That is, for a III. Circle invocation, a person
          spends 15 days.  (The number of watches it takes is 45.)
        </p>
        <p>
          It should not be assumed that clerics are the only people
          with access to ritual invocations.  The Morgathian Prophet
          Balsha, for example, received no formal training in the
          tenets of the Morgathian Church, yet miracles were invoked
          in his presence.  Most clerics feel a prophet appears when a
          church needs to be steered away from a path of action which
          does not please its deity.  Of course, one person&#8217;s
          prophet is another person&#8217;s heretic.
        </p>
        <p>
          Temples are always consecrated ground, and certain areas
          such as crypts and graveyards can be made holy to a specific
          deity by the ritual invocation Consecration.  Peoni and
          Larani are allied and oppose Agrik.  Morgath, the Lord of
          Chaos, opposes everyone, but can be, in some circumstances,
          allied with Agrik.  All other gods are neutral, but tend to
          favor Peoni and Larani.  An invocation call usually consists
          of a quick prayer or chant, but can involve (if time
          permits) construction of an altar, burning of incense, an
          appropriate sacrifice, etc.  The intent is to perform a
          ritual which is less likely to annoy the deity.  It is said
          the powers of Naveh and Morgath arise at night and slumber
          in the light, and those of Sarajin are highest amid ice and
          snow.

          A funeral ceremony to aid a soul to make a quick and
          uneventful death journey.  The intent is for the cleric
          and/or any attendees to give the departed sufficient piety
          to ensure Divine Grace.  Individuals may give additional
          piety by special prayer, etc.  This takes 15 minutes to
          perform and grants one departed soul &#9733; Piety
          improvement.  Multiple castings have no further effect.

          chance for the Ritual skill mastery.  Each volume requires

          <em>Holy Artifact:</em> a consecrated artifact, typically a

          Artifacts store a known invocation for instant activation on
          command.  Cleric determines the number of charges to install
          - each charge takes a casting time of 5 minutes times the
          Circle.  Hence, storing three charges of a Circle V
          invocation cost 3 x 5 x 5 = 75 minutes.  Use of an artifact
          generally requires some sort of triggering or activation.
          Most often, this is done by speaking (or thinking of) a
          particular key word or phrase.  Invoking the ritual requires
          comparing piety against 5 times the Circle embedded.

          The casting time is 2 minutes for each square yard to be
          consecrated.  The area to be consecrated must be walked upon

          (arrows, slingstones, etc) are presumed to weigh 0.1 pounds
          each.
        </p>
        <p>
          <em>WQ:</em> Weapons are rated for quality.  Sturdy
          all-metal weapons like swords have higher ratings than
          hafted weapons like spears.  WQ represents the chance a
          weapon breaks in certain combat situations.  parenthesis.
        </p>
        <p>
          <em>HM:</em> Hand Mode penalties.  All weapons, except Bows
          and Blowguns, can be used one-handed.  There is no bonus for
          two-handed use, but some weapons are penalized when used
          one-handed.  Unless a person is ambidextrous, all weapons
          (except Shields) used in the secondary hand (left hand for
          most) also have a Hand Mode Special Penalty.
        </p>
        <p>
          <em>B/E/P:</em> The impact (damage) of a weapon when it
          strikes.  Weapons may have impact ratings for two or three
          Aspects: Blunt (B), Edge (E), and Point (P).  A - rating
          indicates the weapon does not have this Aspect.  A zero (0)
          rating means the weapon has the Aspect, but impact is +0.
          Point aspects in brackets are optional as a custom option

          Armour can be defined as any article of clothing capable of
          reducing the damage done by weapon strikes.  Even plain
          cloth can help to prevent a blade from cutting.  Higher
          levels of armour protection cost significant amounts of
          money and the extra weight carried increases Encumbrance.
          The nature of this trade-off between armour types tends to
          reflect economic and technological realities, although
          cultural preferences are also a determinant.  Some cultures
          favor heavy armour, others prefer light armour, and a few
          consider wearing any armour to be cowardly.  Climate is also
          a consideration; wearing heavy, padded armours in a tropical
          climate is simply too exhausting to be practical.  Different
          types of armour are usually worn in overlapping layers, such
          as Surcoat (cloth) over Mail over Quilt.  The protective
          values of each layer are added together to determine total
          protection.  Moreover, some body parts may benefit from two
          layers of the same material.  For example, a warrior wearing
          a Mail hauberk and leggings, has double mail coverage for
          the Thigh, Groin, and Abdomen.
        </p>
        <p>
          Combatants must find a balance between the protection
          offered by armour and the Encumbrance penalty it brings.
          Mail, Scale, and Plate armours are heavy.  It may be
          tempting to wear multiple layers of Cloth or Quilt, but this
          is highly encumbering and especially fatiguing on a hot day.
          Each extra layer of Cloth or Quilt (except where they
          naturally occur from overlapping garments) incurs a Special
          Penalty.

          The table assumes average quality materials.  Armour
          materials can be purchased at higher or lower qualities.
          The effect of these ratings (maximum +4) is to increase or
          decrease all protective values by the quality rating.  That
          is, a +1 mail Hauberk has protective values of B3, E9, P6,
          and F2.  No armour aspect can be reduced below one (1).
          Some Jmorvi Shek-Pvar with weaponcraft skill can produce
          enchanted armour.  Such pieces are rare and have +1 quality
          per level of enchantment.  To determine the quality for
          breakage, add all 4 protective values together.

            expensive and is used mainly for helms and spot
            protection.

          Strike location is important for two main reasons.  First,
          only the armour worn at the location struck is relevant.
          Second, injury effects vary by location; a blow to the skull
          is more serious than a blow to the foot.  The percentages
          allocated to body parts do not reflect the relative size of
          that part, since the head, arms, or groin are favored
          targets.  Combatants can influence Strike Location by
          targeting their aim.  Although combatants instinctively turn
          to face the most imminent threat, some armour only covers
          part of a strike location - a breastplate, for example, only
          covers the front of the thorax and abdomen.  In random
          situation, where it is hard to determine whether the front
          or back of a strike location is struck, experience shows
          there is a 75% chance of being struck on the front side.  An
          asterisk (*) indicates that Stumble or Fumbles may apply.

        <h3 id="actions">Actions</h3>
        <p>
          Actions will take their time as desired and will be resolved
          accordingly.  Aborted actions, incomplete actions and action
          being affected by other activity are all possible.  Some of
          the more common actions are listed.
        </p>
        <div class="explain">
          <p>
            <em>Rest:</em> The combatant does nothing except possibly
            sit or lie down.  Resting combatants can attend to wounds,
            do minor weapon repairs, etc.  Time-critical activity
            interrupts rest.
          </p>
          <p>
            <em>Move:</em> Unless physically hindered by obstacles or
            otherwise restrained, this option can take an arbitrary
            amount of time.  If the combatant enters an enemy
            Engagement Zone, he may be attacked.  In the course of a
            Move, combatants may (within reason) change weapons, pick
            things up, etc.  This will be deducted from their speed or
            time spent moving.
          </p>
          <p>
            <em>Engage:</em> Combat is not stationary, it involves
            footwork.  An arms reach plus weapon length is the
            <em>Engagement Zone</em>.  All combatants engaged with one
            another are assumed to be able to move about as driven by
            necessity.  If for some reason this engagement cannot be
            upheld, penalties apply, either to attack or defense.
            Disengage is a move out of the engagement zone of another
            combatant, when they are not willing to continue
            engagement.  This other combatant may choose to follow the
            disengaging combatant and thereby keeping him in the
            engagement zone.  This voluntary footwork has no
            penalties.
          </p>
          <p>
            <em>Charge:</em> At the end of a fast move an attack
            usually gains a bonus.  With steed, a Canter or Gallop
            move is needed.  Note that Stumbles, Unhorsing, and even
            Fall impact may apply.  Also consider any collateral
            damage in the path of the charge.  These may bring the
            speed down.  At the end of the charge the steed may still
            be moving.  Otherwise, the steed halts, which could leave
            the rider and steed in the middle of a somewhat hostile
            crowd.  To continue charging, the weapon must be readied
            again, which can be handled as a grope action.  Cavalrymen
            do not risk their extremely valuable horses galloping over
            battlefields, which are usually well supplied with
            furrows, rabbit holes, man-made pits, and caltrops.
            Galloping normally occurs only on good roads.  A cavalry
            charge is mostly trotting into position, with perhaps
            twenty to sixty yards of canter at the end.  Horses are
            extremely reluctant to charge into each other.  Unless
            both steeds are separated by a short wall, they will veer
            apart beyond the range of most melee weapons.  Charges
            against mounted opponents are rare except in organized
            tournaments.
          </p>
          <p>
            <em>Push:</em> A combatant may intend to push another back
            without grappling him or charging into him.  Opposed Push
            moves may cancel out.  (This is different from ramming,
            which is resolved as a charge, which may also be applied
            to humans, particularly those that intend to use their
            weight as benefit.)  Consider walls and ledges.  Moving
            over a ledge may not be preventable, but moving into a
            wall generally is.
          </p>
          <p>
            <em>Rise:</em> When a combatant stumbles (falls prone) he
            may try to get up; Acrobatics/Tumbling skills apply, as do
            physical penalties.  During a Rise, the combatant is
            considered prone.
          </p>
          <p>
            <em>Grope:</em> Any action taken in combat, which requires
            manual dexterity, but is not an attack.  For example, an
            attempt to draw or change weapons, string a bow, or
            retrieve an item from the ground are Grope actions.
            Physical penalties apply.  The object to be groped must be
            within the engagement zone of the (unarmed) character at
            all times.  During a Grope, the combatant is considered
            prone.
          </p>
          <p>
            <em>Melee Attack:</em> An effort to strike one engaged
            enemy with a melee weapon.  Engaged combatants can move
            about as stated in Engage.  Melee Attacks generally take
            time, looking for an opening, sequencing weapon clashes,
            etc., before the weapon eventually strikes.  Melee attacks
            with a bow or generally with a missile weapon is possible.
            A Shortbow, Hartbow, or Blowgun is treated as a stick, a
            Longbow as a staff, a Crossbow as a club, etc.  A Rider
            Attack may also occur during a Mounted Move.  Rider
            attacks are resolved normally.  A lance may attack
            anything within 5 feet, but a 3-foot long sword or mace
            held in the right hand has restrictions.  Discretionary
            Aiming Zone modifiers for the rider and warrior afoot may
            apply.
          </p>
          <p>
            <em>Missile Attack:</em> Unprepared missile weapons
            (unstrung, packed, etc.) must be prepared by means of a
            Grope (above) and cannot be used until then.  Assuming a
            prepared missile or throwing weapon is available, a
            combatant has one of two options: [1] Fire, which takes
            two seconds for any weapon, or [2] Load, which takes two
            (2) seconds for arrows and sling stones, but 10 seconds
            for a crossbow.
          </p>
          <p>
            <em>Grapple Attack:</em> Any attempt to grapple, hold, or
            wrestle with one engaged opponent using Unarmed Combat.
            The Attacker must move into the location of the opponent,
            which is without penalty.  The attacker attempts to impair
            the usage of limbs (or weapons) without causing fatigue or
            injury.  If the grappler achieves any Strike result, a
            hold on the opponent has been gained.  Determine Strike
            Location normally.  The entire zone (Head, Body, Arms, or
            Legs) is considered tangled, but with arms and legs, left
            and right should be distinguished.  The attacker&#8217;s a
            weapon (e.g. his arm/hand) becomes entangled to maintain a
            hold/entanglement on the opponent.  The attacker can
            release his hold any time (if the weapon was a net, a
            successful grope action is applicable).  The wound level
            implied by the weapon is treated as penalty to any Fumble
            or Stumble rolls.  Tangle/Grapple penalties apply until
            cleared by a successful Grope for weapons or (counter)
            Grapple for maintained holds; tangled weapons may be
            dropped to escape the effect of the tangle.  Note that
            both opponents occupy the same spot and are considered
            prone to all other engaged characters.
          </p>
          <p>
            <em>Grapple Defense:</em> An attempt to escape the hold of
            an attacker.  The defender tests his unarmed combat to
            reduces his hold penalties accordingly.  Of course, the
            defender may instead attempt to grapple the attacker
            himself.
          </p>
          <p>
            <em>Esoteric Attack/Defense:</em> This option is available
            to combatants capable of using magic, or psionics, or able
            to call for divine intervention.  An esoteric option may
            not be available to engaged combatants.  An esoteric
            option that fails may have misfire results that affect
            both defender and attacker.
          </p>
          <p>
            <em>Dropping Items:</em> Items may normally be freely
            discarded without resorting to a Grope.  However, dropping
            an item which is tied on requires a Grope action, as does
            dropping a fragile item that shall not take damage.
          </p>
          <p>
            <em>Tangle Attack:</em> Certain weapons have the ability
            to tangle an opponent or the opponent&#8217;s weapons.
            Some weapons, such as the net, are designed specifically
            for this purpose.  Tangle attacks may be attempted with
            cloaks, blankets, nets, flails, whips, ropes, or other
            items.  If the tangle (or any other attack!) is aimed at a
            weapon, one Main location is replaced with the weapon,
            usually the leg of the other side.  A tangle attack is
            treated as a Grapple attack without the inherent move (or
            missile attack if the tangle weapon is thrown).
          </p>
          <p>
            <em>Block/Dodge:</em> An attempt to block, parry, or dodge
            the attack with a declared weapon (if available), usually
            a shield, although any held weapon, including a hand/arm,
            may be used.  The defender must be aware of the attack.
          </p>
          <p>
            <em>Ignore:</em> This option is normally taken only by
            combatants who are unaware of the attack (or objects).
            This may result from extreme surprise or from the Defender
            being physically incapable of defense.  This is usually
            equivalent to Rest.
          </p>
          <p>
            <em>Mount/Dismount:</em> Mount or dismount in combat.
            Consider this a climb of five (5) feet but use Riding
            skill to determine speed.  (Obviously, a grappling hook
            does not grant a bonus, but stirrup do.)
          </p>
          <p>
            <em>Mounted Move:</em> A Mounted Move is made on part of
            the horse, the rider may act separately.  Be aware that
            horses as large quadrupeds are more easily cornered or
            hindered in movement than medium bipeds such as humans.
          </p>
          <p>
            <em>Steed Trample:</em> An attack by the Steed, commanded
            by the Rider.  The defender may be located in a 2 m radius
            around the steed - horses can wheel and kick in any
            direction (especially backwards) with great force.  Steed
            Trample may be quite useful, if the rider is injured, or
            has dropped a weapon.  A steed trample is like a Melee
            Attack.
          </p>
          <p>
            <em>Polearm Defense:</em> Steeds have great difficulty
            committing suicide.  Faced with a wall of sharp spears or
            stakes they generally balk and refuse to proceed.  This
            survival instinct can only be overcome at great risk to
            the rider.  The rider must make a special Steed Command
            Check with a &#9733;&#9733; penalty.  If the steed command
            fails, the steed makes an emergency stop, bucks, then
            flees.
          </p>
        </div>
        <h3 id="circumstances">Circumstances</h3>
        <p>
          <em>Weather:</em> Wind, rain/snow, mist/fog all have an
          effect on missile accuracy, especially at longer ranges.
          Wet bowstrings lose their tautness and are easily ruined if
          the bow is strung.  When rain strikes, professional archers
          commonly unstring their bow and keep the bow string dry by
          storing it under their helmet.  But if an archer does not
          mind risking a bowstring, a bow can be fired during a
          rainstorm.  Bowstrings have a WQ of -2.  There is also a
          Weather penalty on the archer to reflect reduced visibility
          in rain.  Very cold (wooden) bows often shatter when drawn.
          If the air temperature is freezing, archers who attempt to
          fire their bow sometimes see that their bow breaks when
          drawn.
        </p>
        <p>
          <em>Ammunition:</em> Combatants equipped with a Javelin or
          Shorkana may carry two or three (each is listed as a
          separate weapon).  Most archers carry 12-24 arrows/quarrels,
          an extra bow, and three bowstrings for each bow.  Assuming
          there is a plentiful supply of stones, ammo for Slings and
          Staff Slings can be ignored.
        </p>
        <p>
          <em>Close Mode:</em> Some weapons, especially swung weapons,
          are difficult to use in restricted space.  A Battlesword,
          for example, is superior to a Shortsword when fighting
          outdoors; but, in a narrow passageway or crowded melee, may
          be at a disadvantage.  Generally, any thrusting weapon (such
          as a Spear, or a Sword employing Point aspect) has no
          disadvantages.  Close Mode never penalizes Shields.
        </p>
        <p>
          <em>Target Shooting:</em> Archery contests are popular at
          all fairs.  In such contests, the target is generally set up
          at 100 yards range.  It has a bull worth five points, then
          three concentric rings valued at three, two, and one point.
          The size is 3 feet.  The intended wound level is &#9733;.
          Hitting the target is 0, hitting the inner ring is &#9733;
          and hitting the bull is &#9733;&#9733;.
        </p>
        <p>
          <em>Warhorses:</em> The relationship between a warhorse and
          its rider is profound, almost telepathic in its depth of
          communication.  It takes years to forge and is not lightly
          undertaken.  A knight found weeping on the battlefield is as
          likely grieving over a fallen horse as a dead comrade.  The
          best warhorses require extensive bonding and patient
          training.  Horses are not seriously ridden until they are
          two years old, and very few are combat trained before age
          three.  Although horses do not have the capacity for
          language, they can be trained to respond to verbal commands.
          Several cultures breed ponies for war, notably the Chelni
          and Hodiri tribal nations of H&#226;rn.
        </p>
        <p>
          <em>Steeds:</em> Steed quality is largely measured by Steed
          Morale, although other attributes such as Strength and Move
          are also important considerations when judging a horse.  The
          principal effect of combat training is to increase Steed
          Morale, but Trample Mastery can also be improved.  Steed
          combat training is undertaken by the rider.  The rider must
          invest in the development of his horse as in his own.  Steed
          Morale is reduced by &#9733;&#9733;, when a steed has a
          different rider/trainer.  This becomes a permanent reduction
          if the new rider is the new owner.  The loss can recovered
          through training with the new owner.
        </p>
        <p>
          <em>Barding:</em> Horse armour is rare on H&#226;rn, partly
          due to high cost, partly because the protection gained does
          not justify the encumbrance.  A Thorax strike has a chance
          of striking the saddle and/or saddle blanket.  The
          occasional chanfron (Plate covering the horse&#8217;s Skull
          and Face (except eyes &#0038; muzzle) weight 20 lb, cost
          500d+) is seen on the steeds of rich knights.  Some very
          rich knights defy convention and armour their horses as a
          status symbol, but rarely fight that way.
        </p>
        <p>
          <em>Afoot versus Mounted:</em> A combatant afoot may attack
          the rider or the steed normally.  Aiming Zones may be
          limited.  The rider may defend normally.  The same is true
          in reverse and depends on the length of the weapon in both
          cases.  Warhorses are valuable booty and can usually be
          ransomed or sold.  Many knights consider it immoral to
          attack horses, although footmen about to be trampled are
          less reluctant.
        </p>
        <p>
          <em>Riderless Horses:</em> When a horse finds itself without
          a rider, it will either stand in place or wander off.  Test
          Steed Morale: On success, the steed stays with its rider, on
          failure, it wanders off.  The rate of departure for a
          fleeing steed is generally a canter.

          A battle is a noisy, confusing, scary place.  The clash of
          arms, shouting, screaming (often some whimpering and dull
          thudding) can make it difficult to hear commands and cries
          for help.  For this reason combatants do not always do what
          their superiors want them to do.  Battle experience,
          discipline, and morale are three ambiguous, but important,
          elements in any battle.  All these factors are accounted for
          by Morale, which benefits individuals with high Morale and
          is detrimental to combatants with low Morale.  Having been
          prone in a Combat situation applies a penalty of
          &#9733;&#9733; to Horse Morale, which fades away.
        </p>
        <p>
          <em>Normal:</em> A combatant with normal morale behaves
          without constraint, selecting and executing any reasonable
          action option.
        </p>
        <p>
          <em>Cautious:</em> A cautious combatant will not Engage.
        </p>
        <p>
          <em>Desperate:</em> Combatant tries to conclude the battle,
          one way or the other, as soon as possible.  Until the
          situation changes and a new Morale Test is passed, the
          combatant selects the most aggressive option available.
        </p>
        <p>
          <em>Broken:</em> The individual is unable to fight in any
          useful way.  The only available options are flight or
          surrender.  Flight is normally preferable; surrender is a
          last resort.  If neither is feasible, the individual may
          only directly defend.
        </p>
        <p>
          <em>Rally:</em> The individual has enough combat hardiness
          to support others in their Morale.  He may provide his
          success to Morale rolls of others he can communicate with.
          This is valid for a synchronous Morale roll only.  This may
          be augmented by Rhetoric.
        </p>
        <p>
          <em>Berserk:</em> This is a special state of battle-frenzy.
          Any combatant who enters this mode will take the most
          aggressive action available for Attack or Defense, adding
          &#9733; to Attack Mastery subtracting &#9733; from Mastery
          to defend.  Further Morale rolls are ignored until the
          battle ends.  Some combatants may have a cultural heritage
          of berserking, or a particular reason to go berserk.
        </p>
        <h3 id="wounds">Wounds</h3>
        <p>
          Combatants who sustain Serious or Grievous wounds may die
          during the healing routine.  On the other hand, various
          types of magic, miracles, Psionics, and potions can improve
          healing.  The following wound types exist and individual
          wounds are tracked with their location.  Effects on the use
          of the corresponding part are described below.
        </p>
        <p>
          <em>&#9733;:</em> Minor.  Wounds only have wound penalty.
        </p>
        <p>
          <em>&#9733;&#9733;:</em> Serious. Wounds of this type also
          have minor effects on neighbouring detailed body parts at
          &#9733; less.  Any activity involving these body parts are
          at the appropriate penalty.  These effect wounds do not heal
          separately.
        </p>
        <p>
          <em>&#9733;&#9733;&#9733;:</em> Grievous.  The detailed body
          part cannot be used, serious use effects on neighbouring
          detailed body parts, and minor on main parts.  These effect
          wounds do not heal separately.  Minor effects are at
          &#9733;&#9733; less than the Grievous, while serious are
          &#9733; less.
        </p>
        <p>
          <em>&#9733;&#9733;&#9733;&#9733;:</em> Incapacitating, the
          main body part cannot be used, serious use effects on
          neighbouring main body parts.  (For head this means
          unconsciousness and for thorax imminent death.)  Serious
          effects are at &#9733;&#9733; less than the Incapacitating.
        </p>
        <p>
          <em>&#9733;&#9733;&#9733;&#9733;&#9733;:</em> Destroyed, the
          main body part lost its integrity, Grievous use effects on
          neighbouring main body parts.  (For limbs this means at
          least severed.  Thorax is split open or spinal cord severed.
          For all but the extremities this means instant death.  For
          all other body parts, death is probably imminent due to the
          side effects.)  Grievous use effects are at &#9733;&#9733;
          less than the Destroyed.
        </p>
        <p>
          <em>Fumble/Stumble:</em> A wound level &#9733; above
          (effective) Dexterity on an arm causes any object held to be
          dropped, a Fumble.  A wound level &#9733; above (effective)
          Agility on a leg causes the victim to fall down, a Stumble.
          A combatant is eligible for a Grope action to pick up any
          object dropped.  A combatant that dropped to a Stumble is
          likewise able to get back up.
        </p>
        <p>
          Any wound needs to heal its injury points.  This depends on
          Stamina; medicine may improve the healing rate.  A physician
          may attempt to find or create the correct medicine but his
          skill does not add to the healing directly.
        </p>
        <p>
          An untreated wound is considered as being treated by a
          Physician with the negative wound-level.  E.g. a wound with
          &#9733;&#9733; is treated as a zero (0) quality Physician
          with a penalty of &#9733;&#9733;.
        </p>
        <p>
          The healing routine assumes a combatant will mainly be
          resting during the healing process.  If a combatant gets
          involved in unreasonable physical exertion during Healing,
          the days of rest accumulated since the last day are forfeit;
          wounds are often aggravated or reopened by premature
          activity.  Injury penalties are ignored during Healing.
          Fatigue penalty (if any) are applied - injured combatants
          are supposed to get lots of rest.
        </p>
        <p>
          The standard treatments mostly known by all still need to be
          applied and detailed, so a physician&#8217;s diagnosis is
          always necessary.  &#8220;Destroyed&#8221; wounds may be
          treated as incapacitating, with a Bonus on Diagnosis of
          &#9733;.  Note that the usage effects on bordering regions
          needs to be treated as well.
        </p>
        <include id="$Wounds"/>
        <p>
          Fire and internal system damage is treated as frost, but
          some treatments may not be applied, because they will kill
          the patient.  I.e. cleaning and dressing an internal organ
          is not possible for H&#226;rnic medicine.  A secondary
          treatment to sterilize and seal a Minor or Serious wound is
          Cauterization.  It cannot be used on Grievous or worse
          wounds.  The procedure is done after a wound&#8217;s
          treatment has been established by the normal treatment
          rules.  A metallic object and fire are required.
          Cauterization is attempted at Physician Mastery add &#9733;.
          The effect is to close the wound and modify the Healing Rate
          a second time.  Cauterization cannot be undone or
          re-attempted.  It always leaves a nasty, broad scare and
          Comeliness effects may be applicable.  Amputations and
          immediate cauterizations stop infections.
        </p>
        <p>
          A serious or worse wound may become infected until it turns
          into a minor wound.  An infection is a daily attack on the
          wounded area with a level of the wound, defended against
          with Stamina.  Medicine applies in the same way as for minor
          wounds, but is harder to obtain.  A penalty of &#9733; is
          suitable.  Any injury points gained through the infection is
          added to the original wound.  This may turn the wound into a
          grievous wound.  A grievous wound is a bleeder or otherwise
          makes the body lose vital fluids.  Bloodloss is treated as a
          separate injury.  Note that the circulatory system is
          incapacitated with points in excess of &#9733;&#9733;&#9733;
          as other body parts are.  The circulatory system itself will
          not turn infectious.  Treatment by physicians depend on the
          location.  Some locations are incurable by H&#226;rnic
          physicians.  For multiple bleeders only take the maximum in
          the same extremity, but add those for different extremities.
          Incapacitating and destroying wounds have no additional
          effects over the bleeder and infection dangers.
        </p>
        <p>
          Diseases and Toxins come in various forms.  All of the below
          characteristics are subject to improvements by a
          knowledgeable physician.  Some poisons and ailments may be
          subject to infections.  <em>Deterioration:</em> This is the
          speed at which wound points are accrued.  This can be
          modified by Stamina.  <em>Maximum Injury:</em> The maximum
          amount of injury the wound will cause, after deterioration
          has set in.  Note that healing may prevent the maximum to
          actually be reached.  <em>Heal time:</em> This is the speed
          at which wound points are reduced.  Assume this to set in at
          the same time deterioration sets in.
        </p>
        <h3 id="Jousting">Jousting</h3>
        <p>
          Jousting is a formalized style of combat between two mounted
          contestants, whose object is to charge and strike the
          opponent with a couched lance.  It is seen at most
          H&#226;rnic tournaments.  The rules for winning vary, but
          the most common set is known as the Laranian Joust.  This
          contest is won by the first jouster to accumulate three (3)
          points.  Breaking a jousting pole against an opponent counts
          as one (1) point and unhorsing an opponent counts as three
          (3) points.  Striking any part of the saddle scores no
          points and striking a steed (causing injury) is automatic
          disqualification.  The jousters are permitted to make no
          more than three passes in a bout.  If, after three tilts,
          the score remains tied, or if both knights are
          simultaneously unhorsed, the combatants fight on foot using
          (real) swords or maces.  The first knight to strike his
          opponent three times is the winner, except strikes to the
          shield do not count.
        </p>
        <p>
          Jousts require the use of jousting poles, which are a
          specialty of polearm.  These are listed on the Weapon Data
          Table.  Compared to a regular Lance, Jousting Poles are much
          longer (typically 15feet), more fragile (they are intended
          to break on impact), and the tip is padded or fitted with a
          coronel to prevent the weapon from piercing armour.  The
          price (40d) assumes the jousting pole is painted and fitted
          with a coronel and vamplate.  A plain wooden jousting pole
          costs only 24d.  At Laranian tournaments jousting poles are
          fitted with a flared metal vamplate to protect (B6 E10 P6
          F2) the right hand.
        </p>
        <p>
          Jousters wear the same armour in the Joust as they would in
          war - only more if possible.  While there is nothing in the
          way of specialized armour for the Joust, most participants
          wear great helms and additional protection to the torso,
          such as a Kurbul breastplate.  At most tournaments, jousters
          are required to wear a linen Surcoat showing their heraldic
          device.  Some jousters, particularly the wealthy ones,
          attempt to stand out by wearing (sometimes outlandish)
          crests on their helms and Ailettes on their shoulders
          displaying their heraldry.  Knights may also cover their
          steeds with a caparison that displays heraldic colors and
          device.  Caparisons typically weigh about 30lb and cost at
          least 240d, often a lot more depending on materials and
          design.
        </p>
        <p>
          Jousting is used to settle affairs of honor among nobles
          (dueling).  If both participants and the organizer agree,
          more lethal, regular lances may be used.  It is accepted
          that those too old or infirm to joust, or those of high
          station, may appoint a champion to joust for them, even in
          duels of honor.  The privilege of a lady&#8217;s favor may
          be granted to a noble knight.  The value of such a token is
          purely symbolic, a romantic epitome of the chivalric ethos.
          The nature of the favor can have complex symbolism of its
          own.  A scarf or kerchief is a neutral item, a garter or
          lock of hair may not be.  Some favors are displayed
          publicly; some are not.
        </p>
        <p>
          Jousting is simultaneous combat.  The two combatants spur
          their horses to charge, and then attack each other as they
          pass.  Riding skill has an effect on the jouster&#8217;s
          combat.  Each jouster makes a Steed Command check to begin
          the charge.
