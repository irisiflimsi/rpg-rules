        <p>
          This is a set of rules, which represent the aspects of a
          personal life as it is experienced in the setting.  The
          story-lines of these lives are separated from the
          rule-mechanics thereof.  Any situation that needs to be
          resolved with rules, such as conflicts, can be separated
          into different dimensions.  These dimensions are treated
          individually, but also interact.  This “dimensionality”
          avoids creating constraints in situations that should not
          have them from an inner-world perspective.  Attributes are
          properties of people that can be observed by knowledgeable
          observers in the world, just as occupational or professional
          skills are.  They are reasonable abstractions to be made
          inside the world.
        </p>
        <p>
          All out-world rules are condensed in this chapter.  Any
          competence in-world are abstracted on a five-star scale
          &#9733; through &#9733;&#9733;&#9733;&#9733;&#9733;, where
          exceptional values may go beyond.  Minutes and other units
          more easily measured are applied regularly, but the star
          scale illustrates the difference.  How to turn this into
          numbers for out-world rule operations is detailed later.
        </p>
        <h4>Probabilities</h4>
        <p>
          A new type of die roll is introduced.  You roll a d5 until
          you get a 1 and then count the number of dice that did not
          show up a 1.  That is the same as the number of dice you
          actually rolled minus one.  This roll is dominated by the
          active character, or more generally, the actor.  It will
          generate positive numbers (or zero) and is termed the
          <em>positive</em> roll and abbreviated as <em>p5</em>.
          Example: Peter rolls 5, 3, 8, 10, 2 (in that order) on a
          d10.  He simulates the d5 by taking the result of a d10,
          halving it and rounding up.  He thus rolled 3, 2, 4, 5, 1,
          on a d5 effectively.  His p5 roll would be a 4.
        </p>
        <p>
          Of course, there is a <em>negative</em> roll that is
          associated with the passive resistance or the impediment. It
          is handled in the same way but the negative value is taken
          instead.  Thus in the above example, we would take -4 as
          result of a negative roll; therefore we can simply denote
          the roll as -p5.  These two numbers (from different rolls)
          are added.  The result will be a whole number, called
          <em>n5</em> (n for neutral).  An understanding of this rule
          is crucial, so we elaborate by listing the probabilities
          involved as well as some examples.
        </p>
        <p>
          The first row in the following table shows some of the
          results you can achieve when you roll a p5.  The second row
          shows the chance that you have of moving up one point
          (i.e. right) at any given point.  A p5 can never give a
          result below zero (0) and the chance to get “one more” is
          80%.  Note that this chance is always the same in each
          column.  The third row gives the percentage chance that you
          have of achieving the result in the corresponding first row
          instead of using the p5 mechanic.  These percentages you
          could use for rolling a d100 to get the same probabilities;
          maybe in order to reduce the number of dice to roll.  All
          but the first two columns of this third row are
          approximations.  The last column (with the ...) is somewhat
          special.  It combines the “higher” results and is often
          called exploding in other rule systems.  You could expand
          the table to infinity, if you wanted.  While the extensions
          of the first and second row are quite obvious, the third may
          not be.  It should be interpreted thus: if you roll 91-100,
          you need to roll again on this (third row of the) table,
          read of the result as before and then add 10 to the result.
          (For the mathematically inclined, this is a recursive
          definition, since it is possible that you roll 91-100 again,
          which forces you to roll on this table again and add 20 to
          the net result from the repeated application.  We will see
          this in the examples.)

        <p>
          This table only considers one roll, i.e. the positive.  You
          need to combine both into a single result in most cases.
          Two key observations useful in the future are: Zero (0) is
          the expectation value of the combined roll (n5) and five (5)
          for the single roll (p5).  When comparing numbers directly,
          say skills in a duel, a level 0 skill will only break even
          (or win) against a level 10 skill in 10% of all cases.  This
          is something that can be estimated in-world, and thus this
          rule lies at the border of in- and out-world rules.
        </p>
        <h4>Examples</h4>
        <p>
          To improve speed, several d10 may be rolled in ordered
          fashion.  Order them according to size or alphabetical color
          (e.g. black, blue, green, yellow) or in any other way you
          can remember.  With a d10 stop at 1 or 2.  Computer
          applications that make rolling as easy as pressing a button
          are easy to program.
        </p>
        <div class="explain">
          <p>
            Assume you decided to use the third row of the table, then
            rolled a d100, and get a 24 on the positive roll.  This
            means a result of 1. The second roll for the negative part
            shows a 50, which results in 3. The net result therefore
            is a -2.
          </p>
          <p>
            A more exotic roll would be the sequence 96, 99, 93, 61 on
            the positive d100.  That result would be 34 (positive
            only).
          </p>
          <p>
            Using the standard method (i.e. the second row with a d5),
            the positive sequence on a d10 may show 3, 8, 10, 7, 9, 4,
            6, 3, 10, 10, 8, 4, 2 and the negative sequence shows 3,
            6, 9, 4, 4, 1.  The positive result is 12 and the negative
            -5 with a net result of +7.  If you decide that +7 is not
            precise enough, a roll of 3 and 5 on a d10 (each) gives
            are finer result of +7.35.
          </p>
        </div>
        <p>
          Active/positive and passive/negative are symmetrical.  If
          you imagine one character stealthily evading another, the
          first may interpret the rolls as himself actively evading
          against a passive observation of the surroundings.  That is,
          positive evasion vs. negative observation.  The second may
          interpret the rolls as him actively scrutinizing the
          vicinity against a passively hiding opponent.  That is,
          positive observation vs. negative evasion.  Either way, one
          roll (or a set of two rolls) will determine the same
          outcome.
        </p>
        <p>
          The rolls scale with difficulty.  Imagine that one character
          is particularly strong with a certain skill, but also
          attempts more difficult tasks.  Imagine the child character
          climbing the neighborhood tree and as a grown, experienced
          man climbing an overhanging cliff.  The child's climbing
          bonus of 5 against a difficulty addition of 7 for the tree
          gives the same probability distribution as the adult's bonus
          of 27 against the cliff's 29. It is easily seen why.
        </p>
        <h3 id="additions">Row Additions</h3>
        <p>
          Consider you have two skills of equal value that you want to
          add together.  If the effect of the two skills combined is
          as good as a skill of n points better, we call that
          Row-n-Addition.  This means that two people of the same
          skill with value x have a fair (50:50) chance of beating
          someone with a value x + n in that skill.  Taking the
          maximum of two separate skill rolls is similar to a
          Row-5-Addition as far as the probabilities are concerned.
          (We will only use Row-5-Addition in these Hârn rules.)  The
          “real” value to use when precision loss is important to you
          (rarely) is the math-formula
          <em>5*ln(1+exp(-d*ln(2)/5))/ln(2)</em>, where d is the
          difference.  You can also use the automated formula right
          here.

        <h3 id="s3kills">Skills</h3>
        <p>
          Skills govern all physical and mental activities, such as
          combat and spell-casting.  All skills are derived from
          character attributes and occupations and rated on open scale
          starting from zero (0) as the “default”, with only 10%
          reaching 10 points more.  This is inentionally identical
          with the p5 system of rolling dice.  The skill scale is
          open-ended (“exploding”) as the p5 roll is, but humans
          generally do not get scores beyond 30.  Any activity can be
          organized as a skill.

        <h4>Skill Base</h4>
        <p>
          Skill Base (SB) represents a character’s natural affinity
          for a skill.  The SB for each skill can be calculated when
          necessary.  It is unlikely this varies after the beginning
          of play.  A skill is tested, when its application becomes
          useful or meaningful (a decision by the GM).  Some skills
          should be predetermined, because their application is hard
          to avoid.  Each skill entry below lists the attributes for
          its base.  To determine an SB, the attributes are averaged.
          If an attribute is listed twice, it is counted twice in the
          calculation.  Recall that attributes average around 0.  If
          the character’s Sunsign is listed, it increases SB by the
          indicated number – this is not averaged, but only applied
          directly as part of the SB.
        </p>
        <h4>Mastery Level</h4>
        <p>
          Mastery Level (ML) represents a character’s current
          competence at a specific skill; the higher the number, the
          more skillful.  MLs may be improved in the course of play
          and range from 0 to 30 usually.  Technically, there is no
          limit.
        </p>
        <p>
          Opening Mastery Level (OML) is listed with each skill.  This
          is the starting point for any skill ML.  Many skill start at
          zero (0) and can immediately be improved.  (in the fashion
          described below).  If the number is negative, any
          improvement of the skill can only happen with a teacher.
          Once an ML reaches zero (0) this restriction no longer
          applies.  Sometimes ML denotes the generic value that is
          constant across all situations.  Bonuses and penalties may
          be added in concrete situations and that leads to a specific
          ML, sometimes called EML.
        </p>
        <p>
          Every skill in the list has an Occupation entry.  It shows a
          list of occupations with a percentage value each.  If an
          occupation is listed, then the OML listed is not used, but
          instead the Occupation ML times the percentage listed.
          Multiple occupations are combined through Row-5-Addition.
          <em>Example:</em> Juryn has an SB in Dancing of 4.  The
          occupation listing of 40 for his profession where he has
          level (ML) 20.  Thus his OML is 20 x 40% = 8 and his
          starting EML is SB +<sub>5</sub> ML = 8 +<sub>5</sub> 4 =
          11.
        </p>
        <h4>Specialties</h4>
        <p>
          Many skills can be divided into sub-skills or specialties;
          suggestions are given with some skills.  Characters may
          select specialties at any time.  The skill is then termed a
          group skill and included all (potential) specialties, even
          if unknown.  The specific specialty skill is opened at the
          current group ML.  Each specialty is developed as a separate
          skill.  A character may declare any number of specialties,
          but each is a separate skill.  <em>Example:</em> Bjorni has
          Sword skill at ML 14.  He decides to choose Broadsword as a
          specialty.  Sword and Broadsword are now two separate
          skills.  Bjorni must use his current Sword skill if he uses
          any other sword than Browadsword.
        </p>
        <p>
          Sometimes, only Specialties are given and the question
          arises, what ML in the Specialty implies on the skill group.
          Each specialty has a percentage value associated with it.
          (For a new Specialty, this must be decided upon by the GM.)
          Take that percentage of Specialty ML to get the group's ML.
          For example, a Mask/20% specialty in Woodcraft of 12 would
          imply a Woodcraft group score of 2.4, rounded down to 2.
        </p>
        <p>
          Note that this section applies to ML, not OML.  OML (if
          specialization is attempted at the outset) is as for the
          group skill.
        </p>
        <h4>Skill Testing</h4>
        <p>
          ML is modified for a concrete test, because of fatigue,
          injury, encumbrance, or difficult (or easy) circumstance
          <em>Example:</em> a character might normally have a minimum
          0 in Climbing.  However, climbing an ice cliff, with a
          broken arm, during a blizzard is probably impossible, and
          the GM may feel an ML of -30 is justified.  (This is roughly
          a 1 in 1000 chance of succeeding.)  If instead she was
          trying to decipher an alien script (without access to some
          sort of comparison) the ML may be at -50.  (This is roughly
          a 1 in 100,000 chance of succeeding.)  Factors affecting ML
          are sometimes specified in the skill description; otherwise
          GM discretion applies.
        </p>
        <p>
          When a character attempts to use a skill, n5 is rolled.
          Add/Subtract ML and any other modifiers the GM has noted.
          Some modifiers are “standard” and listed below, they will
          not be mentioned explicitely.  The GM will have decided upon
          a diffculty, often called the <em>negative</em> part.  This
          value is also subtracted from the roll and if the net result
          is not-negative, the skill has been successfully employed;
          if the roll is negative, the attempt has failed.  For
          example, if a PC declares the intent to perform a gymnastic
          feat, the GM would instruct the player to “test Acrobatics
          against difficulty 15.”  In cases where success or failure
          may not be obvious, the GM should make the roll secretly.
        </p>
        <p>
          It is often necessary to know the degree of success or
          failure.  The skill descriptions provide these so-called
          dimensions.  For skills, where no appropriate success levels
          are provided or for newly devised skills, estimate the
          effects by looking at the skills most closely related.
        </p>
        <p>
          When two characters use skills against each other, each
          character makes a p5 skill roll appropriate to the skill in
          question and the success levels are compared to give a net
          result.  The descriptions of the two skills should match for
          this net result (they should obviously the negative of each
          other).  The character with the highest success level
          “wins.”  If both characters achieve the same success level,
          the “stalemate” result of zero (0) applies.  If a tie is not
          appropriate to the situation, then decimal place may be
          rolled as explained in the initial section.
        </p>
        <h4>Penalties</h4>
        <p>
          Penalties are subtracted from the skill roll directly (not
          through Row-5-Addition).  To distinguish the standard
          penalties below, penalties assigned by the GM to reflect
          temporary handicaps are called <em>Special Penalties</em>.
        </p>
        <p>
          <em>Injury Penalty:</em> Combat, and other activities, may
          injure a character.  Each injury is rated in terms of Injury
          Levels: M5, S10, G15, and so on.  A character with, for
          example, one M3 and one S8 injury, has a total of sixteen
          (11) Injury Levels.  A character’s Injury Penalty is equal
          to the sum of all Injury Levels.  For more details about
          injuries, see Combat and Physician.  Usually injury
          penalties apply to all “physical” skills.  In some cases,
          part of the Injury penalty can be ignored.  For example,
          firing a bow with a injured foot is not impeded in the same
          manner as running.
        </p>
        <p>
          <em>Fatigue Penalty:</em> Using Psionic talents or certain
          other activity generates Fatigue Levels.  The GM may also
          assess Fatigue Levels for prolonged physical activity, such
          as when a character swims a swift river and then begins to
          scale a cliff without pausing to rest.  In general, one
          Fatigue Level is assessed for one minute of strenuous
          physical activity.  A character’s Fatigue Penalty is equal
          to the sum of all Fatigue Levels.  Every minute of Rest
          allows a character to remove one Fatigue Level.  Fatigue
          penalty applies to all skill applications.
        </p>
        <p>
          <em>Encumbrance Penalty:</em> Encumbrance Penalty is given
          by the Endurance Skill.
        </p>
        <p>
          <em>Astral Penalty:</em> Astrals of disembodied characters
          have a special penalty to the MLs of all skills, spells, and
          Psionic talents proportional to the portion of Aura they
          leave with the body.  If 5% of Aura is left behind, Astral
          skills are reduced by -2, if 10% of Aura is left behind,
          reduce by -4, and so on.  Some astral travelers prefer to
          leave larger portions of their Aura behind to give their
          body a better chance of resisting possession by an alien
          spirit.
        </p>
        <p>
          <em>Consecration Bonus:</em> This is actually not a penalty.
          It is still applied directly to relevant rituals, i.e. those
          for a deity to whom the ground is dedicated.  The bonus is
          equal to the consecrator's circle.  Under certain
          circumstances, other recipes may also use this consecration
          bonus, for instance, Concocting an alchemical, explosive
          compound in a laboratory dedicated to such volatile
          compounds.
        </p>
        <h4>Skill Development</h4>
        <p>
          At various times in the course of play, the GM decides a
          character has earned the chance to improve a skill.  Some
          skills may be developed by practice/study; some require
          training.  Execute each skill roll as follows: Roll n5.  If
          the roll is greater than current skill ML, increase skill ML
          by one (1); otherwise there is no increase.  This may also
          be interpreted as a “Learning skill” roll, where everybody
          has an learning ML of 0 (but see below) and must match the
          difficulty of his current skill ML.  I.e. the better you
          already are, the harder it is to improve.  To improve
          playability, award 1 roll per gaming session.  Natural
          affinity to a skill applies to learning, i.e instead of a
          learning ML of 0, start with SB +<sub>5</sub> 0.  Use the
          <em>Attribute</em> dimension for that.
        </p>
        <p>
          Additional rolls may be awarded by the GM for extended idle
          periods, for instance in a winter camp.  Or the professional
          life of an NPC “off-screen” needs to be simulated.  In those
          cases, award approximately 10 rolls per month.
        </p>
        <p>
          Characters receive a bonus when being employed by a master
          with a higher ML.  A character getting personal instruction
          from a teacher or employer can add the skill of the teacher
          to his roll but must also subtract 10 due to the difficulty
          in teaching.  Be careful, which teacher you choose!
        </p>
        <p>
          Sometimes forgetting or “unlearning” is called for. Such
          rolls are handled as if the current skill level still needed
          to be attained.  I.e. if the level is not reached through
          the roll, deduct a point.
        </p>
        <p>
          Improving Specialties is a bit more elaborate.  Skills list
          specialties with a percentage value.  This percentage value
          gives the part of the whole group that this specialization
          comprises.  When the skill is improved (the skill group of
          all specialties) all improvement may be dedicated to the
          specialty instead.  For example, 20% Specialty could see a
          possible improvement of 5 points instead of 1 for the group
          and a 40% Specialty a possible improvement of 2.5 points.
          This implies that often fractions need to be maintained, to
          keep a consistent situation for specialties.  To actually
          improve a Specialty, start as if improving the group first.
          If the roll fails for the group, it also fails for the
          Specialty.  But assuming it succeeded for the group, You do
          not simply gain the multiple of points.  Instead, only 1
          point is gained.  For every further point to be gained from
          the possible improvement, a successful p5 roll must succeed
          against a difficulty of all points already gained this way.
          Any remaining fractions can be rolled as rounded to the
          nearest whole number or when “completed” by the next
          successful learning roll.
        </p>
        <p>
          Note: If at any time the whole skill group is developed
          simultaneously, any specialties that already have the lowest
          level reached are not improved.  By treating every specialty
          separately, continuing rolling after the lowest level is
          reached is possible.  This will then only increase the
          specialty by one point, obviously.
        </p>
        <p>
          <em>Example:</em> Assume Alosyn has an Acrobatics of 15 and
          decides to specialize in Vaults.  He manages to beat 15 one
          day, possibly with a teacher, to learn more.  Technically,
          he could be gaining 5 points, since Vault is a 20% specialty
          of Acrobatics.  The first point is already “approved” for
          Vault/16.  He then rolls p5 to see whether he can gain
          another point and with a 3 on his first p5, he now has
          Vaults/17.  The second p5 roll (for the third point) is only
          a 1, so no benefit is obtained.  The third roll is a 9,
          followed by a 6, which means his p5 is at least 2, which
          matches the two points already gained, so he is at Vault/18.
          The fourth roll is 3, 7, and 3 again! Thus his p5 is at
          least 3, which matches his three points already improved.
          He is now at Acrobatics/Vaults/19.  In the future to improve
          the specialty, 19 must be reached to improve Vaults in this
          manner again.  In all other respects he remains at
          Acrobatics/15.
        </p>
        <h4>Special Skills</h4>
        <p>
          Gladiators are at 80%, Hunter/Trappers, Mercantylers,
          Pilots, and Weaponcrafters at 60% for their additional
          Weapon proficiencies.  Clerics open their church language at
          60%, if the same family, and 40%, if an alien family.  The
          church script is opened at 60%.  For those religions that
          have a Temple Private Tongue this opens to 60%.
        </p>
        <h4>Attribute Skills</h4>
        <p>
          Attributes used as skills serve two purposes.  First, it
          allows for the in-world attributes to become operational
          out-world, when rolling dice etc.  Second, it allows players
          to improve this skill as other skills.  The attribute itself
          serves as the SB for the skill.  Since unmodified attribute
          use is a case often encountered, a table is provided for
          easy reference and common values.  A side effect is that the
          average person turns out to have a skill value of around
          five (5).  Values below zero are only reachible through
          “bad” die rolls.
        </p>
        <h4>Skill Combinations</h4>
        <p>
          Situations or skill applications can either fit to a certain
          skill fully or only partially.  Sometimes multiple skills
          may apply.  In any given situation, the GM will state the
          skills that apply and to what percentage.  Then use a
          weighted average as skill.  Example: The GM rules that
          performing a ballet, is 60% Acrobatics and 40% Dancing.  A
          character with Acrobatics/13 and Dancing/9 has Ballet/11
          (rounded).
        </p>
        <p>
          Clerical Counseling is a Row-5-Addition of Rhetoric and
          Ritual.
        </p>
        <p>
          For joining in Rituals, one success roll is made against a
          joint ML (Row-5-Addition).  The normal fatigue is then
          accumulated by both participants.  Example: Dar and Kalin
          jointly invoke Pyrokinesis.  Dar’s ML is 23; Kalin’s is 17.
          Assuming no Universal Penalty, their joint ML is 23
          +<sub>5</sub> 17 = 26.  Both Dar and Kalin each accrue the
          normal Fatigue.
        </p>
        <p>
          Multiple attackers can combine their efforts through
          Row-5-Addition into one.  This is generally a complex topic,
          because modifiers need to be accommodated as they enter the
          game, so this is best reserved for NPCs that perform as
          single units.  Multiple defendants are similarly added.  An
          exception to this is mounted combat, where PC rider and
          horse may be acting in unison.

        <h4>Dimensions</h4>
        <p>
          Dimensions are collected as common reference for the many
          skills that use them in more or less the same manner.
        </p>

          The Divine Grace ratio (Piety : Ritual) is multiple to
          cleric miracle results that effect the caster alone in a
          beneficial way.  Healing, etc.  Note that this ratio will
          usually not exceed 1.5, because rituals are tenants of a
          religion.

        <h5 id="di-acc">Accuracy</h5>
        <p>
          Judging the values of goods produced or performances
          delivered is the same for almost all skills.  This is
          different from the commercial value, which depends on a lot
          of other commercial factors (market size, etc.).  The rare
          occasion, where an ML of the actor can not be judged are at
          GM discretion. i.e. someone who successfully evades
          perception cannot be judged on this “performance” by the
          potentially fooled or only in the most general sense.  The
          value in paranthesis is the range by which the estimation
          may be off.  It is calculated from the percentage value x by
          the range (100% - x) to 1/(100% - x).

          One dimension is the time (in seconds), which it takes to
          achieve the wound level zero on the defender.  The wound
          level is a separate dimension.  You should use trajectories.
          Once a (rolled) progression has reached its goal, a new
          skill roll is necessary.  It is therefore possible to play
          10 second round-based combat.
        </p>
        <p>
          Any effects from wounds or other external influences in
          combat are applied immediately to pending progressions.  At
          the actors choice it can offset the goal or the time.  To
          prevent players from immediately aborting “bad” rolls,
          mandatory secret rolls by the GM can be used.
        </p>
        <p>
          If time is fixed, a best effort attack can be made.  For
          instance, if an opponent was downed and will get up within a
          few seconds and the bonus shall be used for better or worse.
          Since combat is a often used routine, the tables is more
          extensive than usual.

        <h5 class="quality" id="di-qua">Quality</h5>
        <p>
          The Quality dimension can be used when a craftsman attempts
          to produce an item from raw materials.  The result is an
          added to the base value to find the new value.  An item with
          quality less than its base is usually broken.  The results
          obtained do not necessarily reflect market value.  Just
          because an item has +5 quality to its base does not mean
          anyone will pay the difference in pence.  Some finished
          goods may involve several stages of enhancement.  Uncut gems
          may be enhanced by cutting and then further enhanced by
          mounting in a gold-based necklace.  Sometimes an item’s
          resistance to damage is more important than how beautiful it
          looks.  An example of this is weapon- and armour-crafting.

        <p>
          For NPCs the associated table can be used to estimate the
          number of different recipes he knows how to create.  PCs
          should rather keep a book and start with what their master
          has given them.  Self-made dabblers start with zero (0) and
          would need to do research.  Recipes have a wide range of
          meaning, from classic cooking to tricks the character can
          teach to animals.  It includes ritual invocations.
        </p>
        <include id="$D-Recipes"/>
        <p>
          In general, learning a recipe is a roll with the student's
          ML.  The student should have a quiet, dedicated space to
          study.  The <em>Dedicated Ground</em> modifier can be added
          to the ML directly.  The time cost assumes a student spends
          12 hours per day (3 watches) on the task, and study is
          continuous until the recipe is mastered.  The GM may assess
          penalties for interruptions in the study.  Some
          interruptions, like illness or a crisis, may justify
          aborting the study entirely.  Recipes have a circle rating,
          ranging from I - VI, or given as star rating. This is a
          direct numeric penalty when applying the recipe,
          e.g. performing the ritual.  For learning it represents the
          difficulty, see the star-rating dimension.  Now calculate
          the modifiers and make a Learn roll on the table below.  Any
          result below zero (0) means the time was spent in vain.
          Particularly nasty GMs may let the PC learn something wrong
          without knowing.

          twisting in mid-air to land on one’s feet, etc.  Rising
          takes as many seconds as listed in that dimension and during
          that period the character is considered prone.

          The ability to play a role.  Used to determine the success
          of a masquerade or dramatic performance.  Acting includes
          the ability to disguise oneself and/or to assume a false
          identity.  This may imply possession of a repertoire of
          theatrical roles and character portrayals appropriate to
          culture.

        <include id="$Agility"/>
        <p>
          The skill is used for multiple purposes; to avoid falling
          objects, weapon and missile attacks, and other situations
          requiring Agility.  Dodge is frequently used in combat,
          directly as dimension.

        <h5 class="skill" id="sk-agr">Agriculture</h5>
        <include id="$Agriculture"/>
        <p>
          The ability to grow crops.  It determines the
          quality/quantity of crops produced.  Results depend on land
          quality, weather, etc.  Agriculture is also crop management
          ability, useful for running a farm or fief.  Yield is the
          crop yield per year, i.e. this roll applies once per year.
          Different crops may be specialties.  Use the <em>Yield</em>
          dimension but subtract 10 from the skill roll.

        <h5 class="skill" id="sk-alc">Alchemy</h5>
        <include id="$Alchemy"/>
        <p>
          Used for the analysis and/or production of chemical or
          alchemical compounds.  Alchemists devise (or otherwise
          acquire) recipes for their craft.  Use of this skill
          requires access to the necessary equipment, texts, and
          materials.  Use the <em>Recipe</em> dimension for NPCs.

        <h5 class="skill" id="sk-ani">Animalcraft</h5>
        <include id="$Animalcraft"/>
        <p>
          The ability to domesticate, breed, and train animals.
          Animalcraft also includes basic veterinary medicine.  Test
          Animalcraft when breaking or domesticating animals, and for
          each trick/task to be taught.  The time required for various
          efforts is at GM discretion.  More willful and older animals
          are harder to train, and few animals tolerate more than two
          hours training daily.  Each species of animal can be a
          Specialty.  Use the <em>Recipe</em> dimension for NPCs that
          may surround themselves with trained animals.  Intelligence
          in the table means the attribute of the animal to be
          trained.

        <p>
          The ability to chart the stars, cast horoscopes, and make
          predictions based on astrological knowledge.  Astrology
          includes knowledge of astronomy.  The art of using astrology
          to make predictions is called Astromancy; it may serve as an
          oracle or divination skill.  PCs may find it beneficial to
          visit an astromancer to learn the portents before
          undertaking a major adventure.  Such efforts take several
          hours, at least, to prepare.  The dimensions to use are
          <em>Divination</em>.
        </p>
        <h5 class="skill" id="sk-awa">Awareness</h5>
        <include id="$Awareness"/>
        <p>
          Subliminal sensitivity to the environment.  Awareness may be
          tested when a character says something like, “I’ll look
          around.”  It also is tested if an event occurs and the GM
          wishes to determine who might have noticed it, or at least
          have noticed that something is out of place.  Awareness
          rolls are often made secretly by the GM.  Awareness tests
          may be made for sleeping characters with an ML reduction of
          at least 10.

        <h5 class="skill" id="sk-axe">Axe</h5>
        <include id="$Axe"/>
        <p>
          The ability to use hafted, edged weapons.  Specialties
          include Battleaxe, Handaxe, Hatchet, Shorkana (throwing
          axe), Sickle (peasant weapon), and Warhammer.  Poleaxes are
          treated as Polearms (a separate skill). Use the
          <em>Combat</em> dimensions.

        <h5 class="skill" id="sk-blo">Blowgun</h5>
        <include id="$Blowgun"/>
        <p>
          A rare skill except among the Lia-Kavair, clergy of Naveh,
          and certain tribes in tropical and equatorial rain-forests.
          No specialties exist.  Use the <em>Combat</em> dimensions.

        <h5 class="skill" id="sk-bow">Bow</h5>
        <include id="$Bow"/>
        <p>
          The ability to use bows.  Specialties include Crossbow,
          Hartbow (elven composite bow), Longbow, and Shortbow.
          Crossbows: The use of crossbows is not widespread in western
          Lythia.  They are forbidden for military use by canon and
          secular law in all civilized realms, and carrying one may
          draw suspicion and harassment.  Nevertheless, crossbows are
          employed by the Khuzdul, and some brigands.  Only light
          (hand-pulled) crossbows exist.  Use the <em>Combat</em>
          dimensions.

        <h5 class="skill" id="sk-bre">Brewing</h5>
        <include id="$Brewing"/>
        <p>
          Different beverage types may be specialties.  The ability to
          prepare alcoholic and other beverages.  Used to determine
          the quality of brewed ale, beer, cider, etc.  Basic
          materials are necessary.  Depending on cultural background,
          this may include the ability to make wines and spirits.
          Brewing for public consumption is closely controlled by the
          Innkeepers Guild, although it is legal to brew for personal
          use.  Ales do not travel well and most inns produce their
          own brews.  Brewing uses the <em>Recipes</em> domain.

        </p>
        <h5 class="skill" id="sk-cli">Climbing</h5>
        <include id="$Climbing"/>
        <p>
          Tested when a character attempts to climb a difficult
          obstacle.  The GM assesses a climb by the dimensions in the
          table.  Additional modifiers should be made for slipperiness
          and availability of holds.  If the character has climbing
          gear (rope and grappling hook or spikes and mallet) and can
          use them, increase ML.  Speed is measured in feet per
          second.  A running total of vertical progress is kept to
          determine when the climb is complete, and the extent of any
          fall.  A single scale should only be rolled once, but any
          interruption, such as rest requires a new roll.  Any
          negative speed result (below -5) implies a fall.  Climbing
          speed can be increased at the price of increasing the risk.
          For each 5 levels of speed that are accepted as fall,
          increase ML by 1 point.  The following falling height is
          evenly distributed among the attempted climbing height.

        <h5 class="skill" id="sk-clu">Club</h5>
        <include id="$Club"/>
        <p>
          The ability to use hafted, clubbing weapons.  Specialties
          include Club, Mace, Maul, and Morningstar.  Because club
          weapons are omni-directional, they are easier to master than
          axes.  Use the <em>Combat</em> dimensions.

        <h5 class="skill" id="sk-coo">Cookery</h5>
        <include id="$Cookery"/>
        <p>
          Cultural, regional, or even religious specialties are
          possible.  Determines the appeal and nutritional value of
          meals.  Failure by 5 results in poorly-prepared and/or
          bad-tasting food.  Failure by 10 may cause food poisoning.
          Use the <em>Recipes</em> domain.
        </p>
        <h5 class="skill" id="sk-dag">Dagger</h5>
        <include id="$Dagger"/>
        <p>
          The ability to use short-bladed weapons, mostly as secondary
          weapons.  Specialties include Keltan (main gauche), Knife,
          and Taburi (throwing knife).  Use the <em>Combat</em>
          dimensions.
        </p>
        <h5 class="skill" id="sk-dan">Dancing</h5>
        <include id="$Dancing"/>
        <p>
          The ability to perform various types of dance.  Specialties
          such as folk or erotic dancing are viable.  Dancing is very
          important in some cultures, and can be used to enhance
          spellcasting (see HârnMaster Magic).  Dances are social
          interactions.  Without at least visible encounters with
          dances, OML is -10.  Use the <em>Artistic</em> dimension.
        </p>
        <h5 class="skill" id="sk-dex">Dexterity</h5>
        <include id="$Dexterity"/>
        <p>
          Legerdemain (Sleight of hand) is tested when a character
          attempts to perform a feat of manual dexterity without being
          detected by observers or victims.  Examples include cutting
          a victim’s money-purse from behind or moving shells in a
          shell game.  The victim oppose with Awareness to detect the
          attempt.  If the victim is not paying attention, penalties
          apply.  If the result is negative the legerdemain is
          detected.  Awareness rolls may also be made for any
          potential witnesses.  The Awareness dimension is obviously
          modified by the “size” of the feat.  Shells or a coin are
          assumed for the listed penalty.  The Grope dimension is the
          time a trick takes, but mostly for larger objects – this is
          a combat dimension.

        <h5 class="skill" id="sk-dra">Drawing</h5>
        <include id="$Drawing"/>
        <p>
          The ability to produce a likeness, or to assess the artistic
          quality or realism of a drawing or painting.  Different
          styles and media (such as painting, fresco, pen and ink,
          woodcut, etc.) may be considered specialties.  Cartography
          is a specialty of Drawing used to produce poetic maps.  The
          quality of a map is limited by the information available to
          its maker.  Poetic maps are more often judged by the
          attractiveness of the cherubs in the margins than by their
          accuracy.  Characters with Drawing skill may be allowed to
          copy their memory maps in poetic style to sell or show to
          other PCs.  Use the <em>Artistic</em> dimension.

        <h5 class="skill" id="sk-emb">Embalming</h5>
        <include id="$Embalming"/>
        <p>
          Determines success when embalming a corpse against
          deterioration, and when preparing a corpse for
          burial/cremation.  The skill also includes familiarity with
          local rituals; since journeymen embalmers need to travel
          widely, this can result in quite an accumulation of
          knowledge.  Religious and/or cultural differences may be
          treated as specialties.  Civilized cultures take great care
          with their dead – embalming is a sign of respect and honor,
          and has serious emotional and religious overtones.  Most
          temples use master embalmers (either bonded or free) to
          oversee their burial rituals.  Embalming includes limited
          knowledge of practical Alchemy and Perfumery.  Embalmers
          know how to make incense and soap, for example.

        <p>
          Load is the total weight of items carried or worn, including
          clothing, armour, and weapons.  Total Load is recalculated
          as items are acquired or discarded.  Encumbrance Penalty is
          the effect of carried weight on a character’s physical
          activities.  It is equal to Weight carried divided by the
          Maximum Lift (see Strength skill) Weight times Factor dimension.

        <p>
          When holding breath (for more than a few seconds) Fatigue is
          not recovered, as is generally the case while fatigue is
          accumulated.  Multiply the factor to the standard rate to
          get a factual rate.  A factor of 10 means that physical
          activity that normally generates 1 level per minute, now
          does 1 every 6 second.  Remember that the fatigue accrued
          must be used as modifier for the next time interval.

        <p>
          Different techniques may be treated as specialties: Hook and
          Line, Spear-fishing, Net-fishing, etc.  Some characters may
          want to fish with their bare hands.  Conditions are assessed
          by the GM depending on season, locale, and equipment.  Fish
          alone does not provide a balanced diet.  With otherwise
          average condition the base yield is 3 mandays worth of fish.
          Conditions range from excellent +20 to poor -20. (Of course,
          fishing requires a sufficiently large body of water, capable
          of sustaining fish.  Overfishing may imply additional
          penalties.)  Fishing uses the <em>Yield</em> and
          <em>(Yield) Time</em> dimensions.

        <include id="$Fletching"/>
        <p>
          The ability to make and repair bows and arrows.  Base yield
          is 1 bow or 12 arrows in a day, which assumes tools and
          materials are readily available and a 12 hour period of work

          Different cultural types may be specialties.  Knowledge of
          myths, legends, and history.  This is an oral tradition in
          most cultures.  Successful use of the skill means the
          character remembers information relevant to the subject
          being inquired about.  To avoid rolling multiple times on
          the table, the PC that searches his arsenal should give a
          “trajectory” among the two dimensions, after the GM tells
          him how obscure the sought story actually is.  For example,
          Rogan is attempting to recall the name of a great hero of
          some common legend. 50% go to depth and 50% to
          breadth. Rolling a result of 0 would imply that 30% of great
          myths can be repeated and the GM rules that the hero’s name
          belongs to the important part of the myth.  Thus Rogan
          recalls the name: Genin.  Use the <em>Knowledge</em>
          dimension.

          Finding (vegetarian) food in the wilderness.  Tested when a
          character looks for edible plants, etc.  The GM assesses
          conditions depending on season and locale, and uses the
          table to determine the mandays of food found.  Areas near
          civilization are likely to be between 10-20 penalty.
          Excellent conditions exist only in tropical

          Different climate and terrain types may be specialties.  The
          ability to find and identify individual types of plant.
          When trying to find and gather specific plants in the
          natural environment, test Herblore once per watch (four
          hours) of searching.  ML is modified according to the
          plant’s rarity, seeking a plant in an inappropriate locale
          should reduce ML.  Uses the <em>Recipe</em> and
          <em>Knowledge</em> dimensions.  The latter dimension
          describes the recognized herbs, if seen.  The 100% value
          means the set of all herbs the character has been in contact
          with.  Reading elaborate texts suffices, but may give
          inaccurate interpretations in the True:False dimension.  A
          trajectory on the two dimensions should be provided.

        <p>
          Determines quality of furs or hides cured, and the quality
          of leather goods produced.  ML is modified by the quality
          and availability of tools and materials.  Rough-curing
          (removing a hide from a carcass and preparing it for
          transport and proper tanning) can be done in the wilderness
          with only some crude tools.  Uses the <em>Recipes</em>

        <p>
          The ability to assess and/or act effectively within a
          social/political situation over a period of time.  Intrigue
          is used as a discretionary shortcut by the GM to avoid the
          playing out of an information-gathering process.  For
          example, an NPC’s Intrigue might be tested when sent by a PC
          to gather intelligence in a town or camp.

        <p>
          Determines the quality of jewelry and/or fine metalwork made
          by the character.  ML depends on the complexity of the task
          attempted.  Materials are necessary and failure can be
          expensive.  This skill is also used to appraise gems, fine
          metalwork, and/or jewelry. Uses the <em>Recipe</em>

        <p>
          Jumping is tested when a character attempts to leap for
          height or distance.  Results assume a running start; for
          standing jumps, halve heights and distances.  Results below
          0 turn into a Fall.  For each 5 levels of dimension that are
          also accepted as fall, increase ML by 1 point.

          Each Language is a separate skill.  All characters begin
          with at least one Native Tongue, determined by birthplace.
          Some characters may be bilingual.  The GM will tell you the
          name of your native tongue(s).  Clerics also know their
          church language.  (These are not specialties.)  Languages
          are tested only on special occasions, such as when
          foreigners converse.  Characters are presumed to speak their
          native tongues at their social class level, which is well
          enough to make success rolls unnecessary in general.  If
          needed, the duration of the result is a speech, a dialog, or
          other coherent activity.  The ML of a skill using language
          can never exceed language ML in the tongue used.

        <p>
          Morale is a complex issue, it usually applies only to NPCs
          (and trained animals).  The higher a result, the more likely
          the predetermined objectives are followed, usually a
          military one.  The lower the result, the more
          self-preservation is deterministic of actions, but also
          instincts take over.  “Freezing” in the hopes of being
          ignored may make sense with certain predators but not when
          facing Gargun.  The variety of different reactions is great.
          See the Morale section in Combat.  Berserk is meant as
          option, not as mandatory.  The other end at -15 is
          mandatory.  It often makes sense to keep a current level of
          Morale for NPCs that is deducted until it reaches a breaking
          point.  Determine the outcome before any combat ensues to
          improve playability.  (It should be kept secret from

          Turning options are in parts of a full circle (centered
          around the direction of travel).  E.g. at 3 m/s this means
          60° off the direction of travel on either side per second.
          For the sake of playability variance in this should be
          suppressed, although a 20% spread (for a 10 level
          difference) with Agility modification could be appropriate.

        <include id="$D-Move"/>
        <p>
          A steed’s movement rate must be declared before starting to
          move.  Effective movement is equal to its Move minus Steed
          Physical Penalty, then indexed in the Move table to find
          speed.  Horses have four rates of speed: Walk/40, Trot/60,
          Canter/80, and Gallop/100.  The number indicates the maximum
          speed that can be reached.  All speeds are available at all
          riding skills, although commanding the horse to use it may
          prove a challenge.  Horses/Steeds accelerate and decelerate
          at 6 m/s each second, but have the same turning options.

        <p>
          Fatigue is accrued at 10 points per minute (or 1 per 6
          seconds) for the generated maximum sprint speed.  Fractions
          (which cannot exceed 1) of that speed generate the
          corresponding fractional fatigue rate.  E.g. running at half
          the maximum speed gives 5 points per minute (or 1 per 12
          seconds).  Only simple fractions are allowed.

          When the internal system has become incapacitated due to

          dimension is equal to the <em>Recipe</em> dimension in
          values.  The value in this dimension is the number of
          fatigue points a physician removes immediately.  Such an
          attempt may only be made once per subject every minute (by
          the same or different people).  Multiple people working in
          concert may use Row-5-Addition.

          Healing rate is used for wounds/injury.  A physician designs
          a treatment that must continually be applied wuth a first
          roll.  A second roll must be made during the time the
          physician actively applies a treatment (possibly identified
          by another colleague).  The minimum value from these two
          rolls is applied during the healing process.  Often the
          quality of medicine is another factor that comes into play,
          this depends on the therapy. (From the rules it follows that
          the difficulty for first and second roll can be increased by
          5 for a combined roll.)

          A character’s ability to withstand mental domination.
          Mental Conflict is a skill to resolve mental or spiritual
          conflict and can be referred to as a “Battle of Wills”.
          Characters are always aware of an attack, even if
          unconscious or sleeping.  A fatigue rate of 1 means 1
          fatigue level per minute, which is multiplied be the result

          Modifiers: -5 unconscious/sleeping, +5 native spirit, +10

        </p>
        <div class="explain">
          <p>
            <em>Possession:</em> An alien spirit may possess a
            physical body by winning a mental conflict with the
            resident spirit.  Possession is easier if the native
            spirit is absent (disembodied) as an astral.  Reduce the
            ML by 1 for each 5% of Aura that is missing from the
            resident Aura.  The losing spirit suffers Dissolution.  An
            evicted spirit may later attempt to repossess its own body
            (or another) with a mental conflict.  Remember that the
            native spirit (if any) always has +5 to ML.
          </p>
          <p>
            <em>Ethereal Conflict:</em> Two ethereals meet and do
            battle.  The losing spirit suffers dissolution.
          </p>
          <p>
            <em>Artifact Control:</em> A character tries to invoke a
            major artifact’s powers and the artifact resists.
          </p>
          <p>
            <em>Benign Mind Linking:</em> Some healers, for example,
            use mental linking as a way to diagnosis a patient’s
            ailments.  The willing bonus implies an “Ignore” defense.
          </p>
        </div>
        <p>
          <em>Dissolution:</em> Dissolution is the scattering of a
          spirit’s “substance”.  It reforms in p5 hours at the
          location of the spirit’s physical body (if it has one),
          otherwise in a nearby location.  When the process is
          complete, the spirit regains consciousness, has no fatigue,
          and may now engage in another mental conflict.
        </p>
        <p>
          <em>Exorcism:</em> A 5th Circle ritual invocation to aid a
          native spirit evict a possessing alien spirit.  The ritual
          requires frequent laying on of hands and Holy Water.  The
          effect is to increase Mental Conflict ML.  See Religion.
        </p>
        <p>
          Mental Conflict Example.  The demon Karpek (ML 26) seeks to
          possess the Peonian priestess Larinda (ML 18).  Larinda is
          +15 for being the native spirit and living (ML 33).  Karpek
          rolls +9 and Larinda rolls -3, resulting in fatigue rates 1
          per minute for Larinda and 6 per 10 minutes for Karpek.  A
          few successful shock rolls later, Larinda invokes Peoni’s
          Mercy, a ritual invocation that could force the demon to
          depart.  Her Fatigue at that point is (–2) and the Circle
          Modifier (–4), which reduces her Ritual ML to 12 and she
          fails the roll.  The process continues.  This time she fails
          the next Shock roll, allowing the demon its possession.
          Larinda's spirit is evicted and suffers dissolution.  Her
          body now obeys the demon’s wishes.  Larinda’s spirit will
          reform after her (spirit) injury of 4 points are healed and
          she may then attempt to repossess her body (+5 for being a
          Native Spirit) with a mental conflict.  Larinda plans to use
          the ritual invocation Exorcism to aid her task.

          The ability to impress or persuade crowds by logic,
          eloquence, or charisma.  This is something of a shortcut
          skill and discretionary.  An orating PC needs to define the
          audience; mobs maybe stupider than individuals, but they
          cannot be persuaded to step off a cliff.  Rhetoric ML
          cannot exceed the orator’s or the audience’s ML in the
          language being used.  Rhetoric has many uses, from the
          apprehended thief trying to fast-talk his way out of a visit
          to the dungeon, to a friar explaining the mysteries of faith
          to a child.  Rhetoric ML may be reduced or increased
          considering the targets' Intelligence and their best
          interest.  A net result below 0 on any use of Rhetoric
          suggests the character has made a fool of himself and may
          have annoyed the intended target(s).

          <em>Intimidation:</em> Intimidation is a specialty.  It is

          establish dominance.  This is useful in muggings, assaults,

          <em>Diplomacy:</em> Diplomacy is a specialty of Rhetoric

          cultures.  This specialty is important to heralds and other

        <h5 class="skill" id="sk-rid">Riding</h5>
        <include id="$Riding"/>
        <p>
          Riding is used to determine the ability to ride/control a
          steed.  It is tested, whenever the rider attempts to command
          a steed in combat.  A negative result implies a fall.  For
          riders with less skill, an arbitrary penalty to the ML roll
          may be taken.  This penalty is applied to the roll but also
          serves as falling threshold to the (unmodified) roll.  Any
          speed beyond the maximum speed is interpreted as a jump of
          that distance.  For example, Juryn tries to ride a mount
          with top speed of 40 (18 yd/s).  With his skill of 0, he
          tries to play it safe and uses a penalty of 10.  He rolls a
          -5, which is greater than -10, so luckily he stays on the
          horse, but with a -35 he only makes 5 yd/s.  His cousin
          Jirun has a skill of 25 and needs to jump a chasm, so he
          pushes the horse with a +5.  Rolling a 5, he has a total of
          35, he is also lucky and jumps his horse for 10 (28 – 18)
          yards.  High jumps are 1:2 compared to long jumps and
          include a long jump.  Standing jumps of 2 yards wide or 1
          yard high are automatic but must be separated by normal
          movement of at least 2 seconds.  Riding skill rolls still
          apply.  Consult Mounted Combat for potential injuries.
        </p>
        <p>
          In mounted combat, a rider declares his action makes a Steed
          Command check by testing ML.  A success will permit the
          command as desired (and possible).  At -10 the command
          fails.  This effects speed changes and turning, failures
          will have the steed continue what it did or what Morale
          dictates.  After three successive failures, assume the steed
          has a mind of its own until the situation changes
          significantly.
        </p>
        <p>
          Basically, an Unhorsing roll needs to be made, when the
          rider enters the saddle.  An Unhorsing Roll is valid until
          the situation significantly changes.  For minor changes
          simply adjust the existing roll.  Note: A rider “stumble”
          generated by an Melee Attack requires an additional
          Unhorsing Roll. Unhorsing Rolls are made against Riding ML,
          modified by Physical Penalty (including any injury just
          received).  On failure, the rider is thrown and suffers a 5
          feet plus deceleration distance fall. War Saddle: Gives a
          bonus of two (2) to Unhorsing rolls.

          Most know something about their own religion, at least

          ignorant.  For different religions (or if the character’s
          culture, social class, or family is irreligious), then OML
          is at -10.  There is a separate skill, with its own Skill
          Base, for each religion.  Appropriate training, divine
          revelation, or study materials are needed to earn
          development rolls.  Most aspects of Ritual are dealt with in

        <h5 class="skill" id="sk-ste">Stealth</h5>
        <include id="$Stealth"/>
        <p>
          Stealth is tested when a character attempts to move without
          being detected.  The attempt presumes reasonable conditions.
          ML is further modified for distance to the target,
          available cover, etc.  Awareness of potential observers is
          deducted from ML. i.e. added to difficulty.

        <h5 class="skill" id="sk-str">Strength</h5>
        <include id="$Strength"/>
        <p>
          Note that the skill may be improved but not the attribute.
          The listed weight can be lifted excluding your own body.  At
          that point any activity is at -10.  This penalty scales
          linearly down or up, any fraction of the weight carried also
          incurs the same fraction of -10 as penalty.  Note that with
          certain penalties usually trivial activities (i.e. no roll
          required) become difficult, for instance not stumbling.
          Still without tools, activity with both hands is impossible.
          Freeing one hand incurs twice the penalty and assumes that
          the weight is liftable that way.  Fatigue is accrued at the
          1 point per 10 seconds for the maximum lift.  Fractions
          (which cannot exceed 1) of that lift generate the
          corresponding fractional fatigue rate.  E.g. lifting half
          the maximum weight gives 3 points per minute (or 1 per 20
          seconds).  Only simple fractions are allowed.

        <h5 class="skill" id="sk-swi">Swimming</h5>
        <include id="$Swimming"/>
        <p>
          Difficulty of swimming conditions is rated on the Beaufort
          scale.  Test Swimming once for each continuous swim without
          rest.  Any interruption requires a new roll.  With a result
          below 0 the character starts to sink.  Consider currents for
          speed determination.  A swimmer accumulates one Fatigue
          Level for every minute of swimming at speed, but may rest by
          treading water.  A resting swimmer rolls to see if they
          sink, but does not move (except with the current).
          Underwater Swimming is at half speed.  When attempting to
          convey a conscious swimmer, apply a penalty of 5, for an
          unconscious person apply a penalty of 10.
        </p>
        <include id="$D-Swimming"/>
        <p>
          If a character is in water deeper than their height, a Sink
          result implies the character goes down with the speed of the
          negative result.  (I.e. -5 means going down at 0.75 ft/s.)
          A reroll may be attempted every second, but fatigue applies
          immediately.  A character who can no longer hold his breath
          (see Endurance) and spends more (consecutive) time
          underwater than they can hold their breath passes out, the
          character’s lungs fill with water, they stop breathing, and
          the character will receive Drowning damage.  An unconscious
          character removed from the water may be revived with
          standard physician/healing mechanisms.

          Throwing for accuracy is covered under Missile Combat.  When
          throwing for distance, an “ideal” throwing object is
          spherical, weighs three ounces and fits comfortably in the
          hand.  An ideal situation is one where the thrower has room
          to swing arms, good footing, and no distractions.  Heavier
          objects reduce ML.  When throwing with little/no attempt at
          accuracy, the table indicates the distance an ideal object

          The basic distribution presented in the in-world chapter for

          If multiple occupations are learned, they add through
          Row-5-Addition, when applicable.  In particular, Parent

            <em>Negation:</em> Creates a field whose radius is this
            dimension in feet times the invoker’s 0+<sub>5</sub>Will.
            Any spell/talent rolls are reduced by the ML of the
            invoker.  This is a separate dimension and can be combined
            with the radius.  A field of less than 1 foot implodes and
            fails.

            <em>Pyrokinesis:</em> No effect on entities with Aura or

            <em>Telepathy:</em> The intended target must have a
            minimum Aura of 1, and is usually someone the invoker
            knows quite well.  ML is reduced if this is not the case.
            If nothing about the intended target is known, besides
            tell-tale existence, the penalty is -30.

          <em>Sin, Piety, &#0038; Morality</em>: If a character acts
          in a manner inconsistent with their god’s morality, the GM
          should deduct Piety depending on the extent of the sin.  Sin
          penalties can be imposed directly, but subtle deductions by
          the GM are better.  The GM may also adjust a character’s
          Morality based upon actions over time.  Characters with a
          Piety total that equals or exceeds their Ritual Mastery are
          said to have Divine Grace.

          Some rituals are lay rituals as described in the Religion

          a Piety benefit, if attended and an (individual’s) Ritual
          roll succeeds.  The benefit is a Row-5-Addition to Piety,
          which is why the “negative benefit” is actually positive.

          Divine intervention is totally at the GMs discretion and the

          faithful clerics.
        </p>
        <h3 id="c3ombat">Combat</h3>
        <p>
          <em>A/D:</em> Weapons give bonuses to combat skills based on
          their effectiveness to attack or defend.  A Roundshield, for
          example, rated as 1/4, is poor for attacking, but excellent
          for defense.  The ML used in combat when attacking with a
          weapon adds the first (A) value.  The Attack ML of a Spear
          (A:4) at ML18 is: 18+4 = 22.  The ML used in combat when
          defending with a weapon adds the second (D) value.
          <em>HM</em> is also directly added to ML.  <em>WQ</em> is
          used as skill, not as attribute.
        </p>
        <div class="explain">
          <p>
            <em>Rest:</em> Fatigue gained by any conflict recovers at
            one Fatigue Level every minute.  With dissolution, fatigue
            turns into injury.  Note that spirits can take arbitrary
            injury before being destroyed and may heal forever.  Only
            in rare cases (e.g. divine intervention) can spirits be
            destroyed.
          </p>
          <p>
            <em>Move:</em> Use the Move skill to determine speed.
            Subtract 2 from Missile ML for being mounted.  Subtract
            the speed difference in m/s between attacker and defender
            perpendicular to the shot direction.  To avoid lengthy
            calculations, subtract 50% of the attacker speed instead.
          </p>
          <p>
            <em>Engage:</em> Because the potential exists to
            attack/influence entities that come within range, each
            character has an Engagement Zone of 5 ft radius about him
            that do not extend into blocked areas.  The Engagement
            Zone of a conscious, prone character is only half that
            around his body.  This means a standing character is often
            not engaged by an adjacent prone enemy, although the prone
            character may be engaged by the standing character.
            Similarly, two adjacent prone characters often do not
            engage each other.  Unconscious characters have no
            Engagement Zones (not even the space their own body
            occupies) but may constitute obstacles.  A character may
            be attacked upon entering an enemy’s Engagement Zone until
            he leaves that zone.  This entering may be active or
            passive.  It is possible to be engaged with an arbitrary
            number of enemies at a time.  A character with a long
            reach weapon has an appropriately larger engagement zone
            and may therfore be eligible to attack before others.
            This may be of importance for mounted Charges into a row
            of Pikemen.
          </p>
          <p>
            <em>Charge:</em> Requiring a steed to halt may imply
            multiple attacks due to deceleration restrictions.  Every
            engagement along the way may attack the steed/rider as
            usual.  If the intent is to cause little damage, use the
            unintentional hit rules for melee (see below).  Otherwise
            consider the group passed by to be the target and scale as
            per “wild” result in the missile attack section.  Instead
            of the 60 degrees +/-2 distance, collect all in the path
            of 5 feet width.  Any attacker plunging into defenders
            with an attack will decelerate at maximum rate, and that
            automatically determines the length of the path and the
            duration of the ride.  At the riders discretion this can
            be broken down into separate attacks.  If a mounted charge
            against moving objects is attempted, a Steed Command Check
            with a -10 needed the second before impact.
          </p>
          <p>
            <em>Push:</em> The push attempt may range between 0 and 5
            feet and must be in the direction the attacker is facing.
            The defender has a choice to evade into a semi-circle of
            up to 120 degrees, assuming no obstacles.
          </p>
          <p>
            <em>Rise:</em> Use Acrobatics skill.
          </p>
          <p>
            <em>Grope:</em> Use Legerdemain skill.
          </p>
          <p>
            <em>Melee Attack:</em> The rider and horse may act in
            unison and add their combat skill per Row-5-Addition.
            Both accrue the same fatigue.  Hitting the wrong target
            can happen in melee combat.  Usually this is ignored, but
            if this ignorance is taken into account when deciding on
            options, such accidents shall be played out.  Anybody
            within the range of the weapon is subject to a skill roll
            with a penalty of 10. This can be added to the benefit of
            other attackers as per multiple attacks above or resolved
            individually with the goal of 0 damage.
          </p>
          <p>
            <em>Missile Attack:</em> For throwing arbitrary objects,
            use Throwing skill.  Since missile attacks are resolved
            with individual shots, a missed attack is applied only if
            the intended attack had no impact.  Count all potential
            targets completely in an arc of 60 degrees and +/-2 range
            levels of the intended target.  Use Row-5-Addition of
            zeroes, but reduce by 5 for the missed, intended opponent.
            If a hit is scored on the much larger target, roll which
            target is hit by distributing evenly among all the
            unintended targets.  When determining hit chances and
            damage apply the size modifier from the Size table below.
            At GM discretion, inanimate objects not participating in
            the skirmish may be counted as potential targets,
            particularly, if the actual targets are spread widely
            across the area.  This increase can be used purposefully
            and can be quite devastating when firing at advancing
            troops. The Missile Attack table below reduces calculation
            for playability.  Penetrating hits are ignored, i.e. no
            shots through multiple targets.  The assumed skills rolls
            all use 0 damage and no personal, e.g. aiming, modifiers.
          </p>
          <p>
            <em>Grapple/Tangle:</em> Use Unarmed Combat skill.
          </p>
          <p>
            <em>Block/Dodge:</em> For dodging, use Dodge skill.  Dodge
            and Block/Parry are added through Row-5-Addition, if used
            together.
          </p>
          <p>
            <em>Steed Trample:</em> Use steed ML (and penalties) only.
          </p>
          <p>
            <em>Polearm Defense:</em> Remember the Reach of Long
            weapons. Usually Steed Stumble Roll, followed by an
            Unhorsing Roll is necessary to continue a Charge into
            polearms (assuming the Steed Command Check was
            successful).
          </p>
          <p>
            <em>Aiming:</em> The Attacker may declare one Main area as
            not being hit for a penalty of 1 to ML. This choice can
            be taken multiple times, but the remaining Main locations
            must remain (bodily) connected.  If all but one Main
            location has been eliminated, individual percentage points
            may be reduced for a Detail area.  This penalty can again
            be taken multiple times but the remaining Detail hit
            locations must be (bodily) connected.  The GM may restrict
            or penalize the choice of Aiming Zone if the attacker
            could only reach certain target zones with the declared
            attack weapon.  A prone attacker would find it difficult
            to aim high on a standing opponent.  The Size table can be
            used, if the target is smaller than man-sized. This effect
            does not cummulate with aiming for parts of a target (the
            main part of this paragraph).  There is no modification
            for man-sized creatures, unless the target offers a
            smaller effective target.  A prone man, for example,
            presents a target about 2 feet tall, and a crouching man
            about 4 feet tall. Similar height adjustments may apply to
            other targets at GM discretion.
          </p>
          <p>
            <em>Outnumbered:</em> The ML for any defense is decreased
            by 2 for each engaged enemy above one that is not ignored.
            (This includes prone enemies.)  That is, a character
            outnumbered 3:1 subtracts 4 from ML for all defense rolls.
          </p>
          <p>
            <em>Prone:</em> A character who is attacking (or being
            attacked by) a prone enemy increases ML by 4.
          </p>
          <p>
            <em>Stop:</em> A stop from a sprint/charge faster than the
            maximum “natural” deceleration rate may be
            necessary. (Running into a wall or head on into another
            opponent that doesn’t dodge.)  In that case consider the
            distance that is not available to stopping as fall.
            Surface is considered at 30°.  This damage is taken by the
            steed (or the runner).  An appropriate strike location
            should be chosen. If the obstacle is reasonably capable of
            taking damage apply it there too.  (If desired, use
            physics of an inelastic collision, i.e. when running into
            a wagon that starts to roll when run into. Damage always
            applies to both.)
          </p>
          <p>
            <em>Fall:</em> Acrobatics can be used to moderate a fall.
            All successful points on Acrobatics vs 15 can be used by
            the faller as in Aiming, i.e. the main and detailed body
            part to land on.  The slope of the surface may cause a
            falling climber to hit several times on the way down.
            When this occurs, reduce damage to what the incline is as
            part of 90°. E.g. 30° would reduce the damage to 1/3.  A
            character may be able to stop falling by grabbing
            protrusions, bushes, etc.  This rarely stops the fall, but
            may slow it and reduce landing impact.  Randomize an M1
            type B wound to the hands and deduct 1 ft from the height.
            The wound impact can be increased up to M10 for a
            corresponding reduction. If so desired, the fall can be
            stopped at a random location and the falling damage
            recalculated.  Damage is then aimed with +20 at the
            grabbing arm.  This grabbing cannot be used together with
            Acrobatics. The character now hangs from the
            protrusion. Falls use the Fall table.  Various
            surfaces modify fall impact: <em>Water (up to 10 ft):</em>
            -1 / ft.  <em>Mud, Bog:</em> -2.  <em>Stone:</em> +3.
            <em>Uneven, Rocks:</em> +6.

          The chance for the pole to break is equal to the impact it
          causes (before armor reduction).  The chance for a shield to
          break is the amount of damage is absorbs (provided it is
          hit).  If the shield breaks, reduce strike impact by 3
          further points.
        </p>
        <p>
          If your pole does not break, your opponent may be injured.
          Determine Strike Location and effective impact normally.
          Because there is more chance of being struck on the left
          side of the body, roll 1d4 for strike locations with two
          sides: 1-3 = left; 4 = right.  If the location struck is
          covered by a shield (see above) a shield damage check is
          made.  If the shield does not break, it deflects the strike
          and there is no effective impact.  Otherwise, determine
          injury effect as normal.  Any strike, including one by a
          broken pole, requires an Unhorsing Roll.  Also, if the
          strike impact exceeds the target’s STR (before armour
          reduction) an unhorsing roll is required.
        </p>
        <h4>Special Wounds</h4>
        <p>
          <em>Drowning:</em> While incapacitated, the internal system
          takes 1 injury and 1 fatigue point every 6 seconds until
          fresh air is available.
        </p>
        <p>
          <em>Bloodloss:</em> damage taken increases at Impact - 10
          per 10s. For example, a 12 point injury causes 2 points per
          10 seconds, or 1 point of bloodloss to accrue every 5
          seconds.  (A 22 destroying wound causes more than 1 point
          per second in bloodloss and only very unlikely circumstances
          will keep the victim alive for more than 15 seconds.)
        </p>
        <p>
          <em>Inanimate Damage:</em> Instead of (autonomous) Healing,
          Repair must be applied externally.  Use the appropriate
          Craft skill instead of Physician.
        </p>
        <p>
          <em>Weapon/Armor Damage:</em> Weapon and Armour make a Shock
          roll for the damage that they absorb, respectively
          deal. This includes grappling damage.  Weapon Quality (WQ)
          is used instead of Stamina skill.
        </p>
        <p>
          <em>Fumble:</em> Any new wound of at least 1 point to arms
          results in a Fumble chance.  Use accumulated damage to that
          extremity as difficulty for a Dexterity skill roll. Failure
          results in dropping anything held on that arm.
        </p>
        <p>
          <em>Stumble:</em> Any new wound of at least 1 point to legs
          results in a Stumble chance.  Use accumulated damage to that
          extremity as difficulty for an Agility skill roll. Failure
          results in dropping prone.
        </p>
        <p>
          <em>Shock:</em> Any new wound of at least 1 point results in
          a Shock chance.  Use accumulated injury and fatigue as
          difficulty for a Stamina skill roll but subtract 10.
          Failure results in unconsciousness.

        <h4 id="morality">Morality</h4>
        <p>
          Individuals should have a moral compass.  Morality is a
          measure of unselfishness.  The following serves as a
          guideline of the diversity found in Hârnworld, but is by no
          means exhaustive.  Sindarin tend towards the “higher” moral
          standards.
        </p>
        <p>
          Customary description of Morality include: <em>Diabolical,
          Unscrupulous, Corruptible, Law-Abiding, Principled,
          Exemplary.</em> They are not always applied correctly when
          dealing with enemies or friends.  Moral description from
          others tend to be worse when describing an enemy.
        </p>
        <h4 id="sexuality">Sexuality</h4>
        <p>
          People have a descriptive sexuality.  The distribution of
          sexuality in Hârn is roughly 90% heterosexual, 5% bi-sexual
          and 5% homosexual.  Other forms of sexuality may exist but
          are hidden.
        </p>
        <h4 id="species">Species</h4>
        <p>
          Although Hârn has many exotic creatures, Humans, Sindarin
          and Khuzdul are by far the most commonly encountered.  The
          population distribution on Hârn is approximately Human
          (97%), Sindarin (1%), and Khuzdul (1%).
        </p>
        <h4 id="gender">Gender</h4>
        <p>
          Among encountered humans 48% are male, among Sindarin 45%,
          and among Khuzdul 75%.  (Other individuals encountered are
          female.)
        </p>
        <h4 id="birthdate">Birthdate</h4>
        <p>
          Every day of the year (360) has an equal probability of
          being the birthday of a random person.  In other words: they
          are evenly distributed.  Names of calendar months are
          readily available in other sections of Hârnworld.
        </p>
        <h4 id="sunsign">Sunsign</h4>
        <p>
          Sunsign is a major factor for skill-affinity, but all
          sunsigns have advantages and disadvantages.  Sunsign is
          determined by birthdate.  The first two and last two days of
          each sign are termed the cusp: a person born on the 1st
          of Ilvin is termed a Tai-Skorus Cusp (the actual sunsign is
          named first).  Those born on the cusp enjoy the benefits of
          either sign.  Hârnic astrology reveals the Pvaric nature of
          Kelestia.  Personality descriptions for each of the twelve
          signs of the zodiac are given in HârnPlayer.  The
          personality of a person born on the cusp would be a blend
          of the two signs.

          HârnWorld regional modules provide Birthplace generation
          tables.  The GM may assign you a birthplace, or tell you

        </p>
        <h4 id="culture">Culture</h4>
        <p>
          A person’s Culture is determined by Birthplace.  Most people
          born on Hârn are Feudal.  Common exceptions are: Imperial
          (Tharda), Viking (Orbaalese), Tribal, Sindarin, and Khuzan.
        </p>
        <h4 id="socialclass">Social Class</h4>

          The Social Class is usually not something considered random.
          The table shows the distribution of all classes, should a
          hypothetical census be taken.  It may be useful to determine
          the Social Class of a randomly encountered individual.  For
          some cultures a random result does not make sense
          (e.g. Slaves in Kaldor).  Refer to the relevant HârnWorld

        <p>
          About a third of all individuals encountered are first-born.
          Of the remainder, a third is a second-born and so on.  For
          Sindarin and Khuzdul 50% are first-born and of the
          remainder, 50% are second-born instead.  The sex and age of
          each sibling may be determined accordingly, with a 60% of
          each still being alive.  To determine the number of
          siblings, determine the rank of the last sibling as before,
          but which obviously must come after the indiviual's rank
          already determined.

            together, 20% see either the father or the mother absent
            (desertion, divorce, etc.).  In the remaining 20% either
            the father or mother is dead, in half of the cases the

            <b>20%</b> of all people were fostered; they lived with

            Guilded apprentices are usually fostered with their
            masters, as are squires training for knighthood.  Poor
            families, especially those with only one parent, commonly
            foster one or more children with a relative or neighbor.
            Fostered children are usually aware of their parents’
            identity.

            <b>15%</b> are Bastards. Parents never married, most
            likely because the father was of a higher social class, or
            one (or both) parents were already married or
            betrothed. Acknowledgement happens only in a third of all
            cases. A bastard usually lives with his mother, but may
            reside with father if acknowledged.

          It is the habit of the upper classes to spread their oats
          throughout the lower classes; if unacknowledged, the real
          father may never be known, but then again, he may be someone
          of wealth and power who could be helpful.  Acknowledging a
          bastard is a significant act; the admission can have
          important emotional ramifications for both parents,
          especially to their respective spouses.  In families where
          there is property and/or titles to inherit, acknowledged
          bastards usually follow the youngest legitimate heir, but
          dynamic characters may do better, especially if they happen
          to be a father’s eldest son and the legitimate heirs are
          weak.  Many a dynastic bonfire has been ignited with such a
          spark.

        <h4 id="estrangement">Estrangement</h4>
        <p>
          Estrangement measures a person’s popularity in the clan,
          tribe, and/or family.  It has a significant effect on
          opportunities, including any inheritance.  Being the eldest
          child of a knight is less advantageous if he hates
          you. Siblings with different estrangements are often jealous

        <p>
          A person’s relationship to the Clanhead is often more
          important than to parents.  Hârnic clans tend to be large.
          Some live in close proximity.  Some number in the thousands
          and are widely dispersed.  Wealthy and noble clans are often
          extended.  Poor clans are likely to be smaller, especially
          if they live in major settlements.  Poor families in the
          same town or district may have the same clan name, but have
          been out of touch for generations.  Except for outcast
          characters, the clanhead can always provide shelter and a
          hot meal.  In some cultures, maternal relationships are more
          important.
        </p>
        <p>
          The hypothetical census would have for a person: 15% father
          or mother as the clan head, 10% a cousin, 25% an aunt or
          uncle. All others (50%) identify the clanhead as distant.
        </p>
        <h4 id="height">Height</h4>
        <p>
          The average height of a Hârnic male human is 68 inches with
          a variance of 5.83. The average is modified: Sindarin: -3",
          Khuzdul: -14".  Human females: -2", Sindarin females: 1".
          Ivinian +1”, nobility +2”, urban poor -2”.  Such
          measurements are often made by Physicians, while averages
          and variance thereof are only calculated by excentric
          scholars.
        </p>
        <h4 id="weight">Weight</h4>
        <p>
          On Hârn, the “optimal” weight of a person depends on his

          usually published in a yearly almanach.

          The Clothiers' Guild and others have agreed on a size
          measure that relates to weight and is only a scale from
          1-10.  The apparent distribution of sizes is recorded here.
          Items that are too small or too big cause discomfort.  A one
          size difference may be acceptable.  The distribution was
          calculated on the human population alone.  Non-humans were
          too rare, when the data was sampled, but their sizes have
          been standardized by the guild none-the-less. (Weight is in
          lbs.)

          Frame is another proportional attribute mainly used by
          Clothiers.  It is measured in five main categories. It is
          determined by the actual instead of the optimal weight to
          height ratio.  The optimal <em>Weight : Height</em> ratio is
          considered 100%.

          Physical ability is assessed by the military (including
          their physicians) and a five-star rating is used.
          Non-humans often have their own physiology - that is
          recognized in the statistics.  (The scale is extended to six
          stars for exceptional non-humans.)
        </p>
        <p>
          <em>Agility</em> moves the body. Agility is useful for
          warriors, seamen, and dancers.
        </p>
        <p>
          <em>Dexterity</em> is the ability to manipulate objects with
          the hands. Dexterity is important for warriors and
          cut-purses.
        </p>
        <p>
          <em>Stamina</em> is the general physiological
          condition. Stamina determines for how long wound healing
          takes and also affects disease and poison resistance.
        </p>
        <p>
          <em>Strength</em> is sheer physical power, a crucial
          attribute for combat and other physical activities, which is
          why military types usually assess it.  It is common
          knowledge that additional weight leads to increased
          strength.  However, this has not been measured accurately
          and not any weight leads to an increase in strength.  It is
          also unknown whether the same relationship to weight exists
          for Sindarin and Khuzdul.

          Physicians collect the data for the senses, often diseases

          <em>Eyesight</em> is the ability to see in daylight.  Except
          for nocturnal creatures (like Gargun) eyesight is reduced in
          the dark and that affects all activity requiring vision.

          <em>Hearing</em> is used to sense sound.  This is essential

          <em>Smell</em> estimates sensitivity to odor and taste.
          This can be useful for hunting and/or tracking, and may warn

            milk, cereals, or shellfish.  When the substance is
            nearby, a person suffers from sneezing, wheezing, and
            coughing.  This results in reduced abilities until the
            allergy source is avoided or removed.  Eating allergic

          Shek-Pvar and Priests collect the statistics for these
          attributes.  They are not willingly shared, only few
          scholars have access to the combined treasure of these
          numbers.  A five-star rating is used.  (The scale is
          extended to six stars for exceptional non-humans.)
        </p>
        <p>
          <em>Intelligence</em> is the ability to reason and
          articulate.  Often the following descriptions are used for
          the star scale:
        </p>
        <div class="explain">

          <em>Aura</em> is Psionic concept.  Hârnic philosophers
          believe that all living things have Aura and that the
          physical body is simply a place where the immortal spirit
          currently resides.  High Aura indicates high psychic
          ability, and is the most important attribute for Psionics
          and magic (although Will and Intelligence are also vital).
        </p>
        <p>
          <em>Will</em> encapsulates mental strength, tenacity, and
          patience.  A person with low Will lacks confidence, panics
          easily, and has difficulty with tedious tasks.  Those with
          high Will are resolute, confident, and stubborn.

          Phobias, manias, and other mental disorders can be
          disruptive.  The list of mental disorders is not
          comprehensive.  Mental disorders of the same type may have
          different severities.  A phobia is an irrational
          fear/aversion.  When likely to be stimulated by an
          appropriate situation, a person's Will is tested to
          determine if the phobia can be resisted or not.  If relief
          is impossible, the person may faint, become hysterical, go
          berserk, etc.  A mania is an irrational fascination,
          obsession, or compulsion, usually to excess.  An individual
          with Pyromania takes every opportunity to start a fire; with
          Hydrophobia he is unlikely to enjoy swimming, boating, etc.
          Severity of the disorder is, of course, relevant in the
          actions that are taken.  Some disorders are only latent and
          the level of Severity is unknown.  It is quite possible for
          someone with Acrophobia to climb a mountain with no
          problems, but panic sitting atop a twenty feet wall.
          Phobias are irrational.

        <p>
          The list is compiled by specialized physicians but also by
          Savorya Shek-Pvar.  A prevalence is not given, nor is the
          chance of multiple disorders given.  The list is considered
          harmful, if it were to leak into the public.  Translations

          tongues but sufficient funds.

          * The person may change personality in stressful situations,
          based on his Will.  The primary personality is neurotic and
          totally unaware of the secondary personality. The latter, on
          the other hand, is aware of the primary personality and
          often takes desperate actions to try and overcome the
          neurosis of that personality.

          Gods or goddesses may be worshiped (however laxly) by any
          person.  While people may respect and acknowledge the
          existence of any number of deities, they usually only follow
          one, although it is possible to change religion.  The
          religion a person may encounter depend on a lot of
          circumstances and depends on the birthplace.  Available
          choices are presented in other Hârnworld publications, which
          also consider culture and social class.  Most people tend to
          follow the deity of their parents or guardians.
        </p>
        <p>
          While there are chivalrous worshipers of Morgath and corrupt
          Laranians, people tend to be more satisfied if their morals
          matches that of their deity.  Churches and clerics, unaware
          of an individual’s true morality, may be fooled.
        </p>
        <p>
          People may faithfully ascribe to two or more religions,
          provided the deities are not diametrically opposed.  Some
          miscreants may try to subvert an opposing religion, but this
          is not faithful.  Some rare people may consider themselves
          godless.  Divine intervention is another word for miracle.
          However, the acts of deities should never be confused with
          spells, which are the acts of mages.

          A simple peasant may possess little more the clothes worn, a
          knapsack containing their worldly possessions, credentials
          when appropriate, and a money-belt.  Most travel afoot, but
          nobles require a horse.  A person's wealth is largely
          dependent on family wealth, which is relative to social
          status.  The census data compiled by the crowns provide the
          following table and shows three levels of wealth within each
          social class. The value given amounts to what a person is
          assumed to possess when becoming of age, i.e. a responsible
          subject of the souvereign.  This wealth may be used on items
          from the Price List on HârnPlayer and the Weapon and Armour
          tables.  Estrangement can also influence funds.

          Squires are traditionally equipped by their lord when
          knighted.  This includes weapons, armour, and a good steed.
          Family wealth above does not include this.  Very few Hârnic
          folk own property.  Rural freemen and serfs rent cottages
          and land from the lord.  City homes are mostly owned by a
          few wealthy folk and rented to poorer citizens.  Only
          established urban guildsmen can hope to buy a private home.
          Most rural households own a few sheep or goats, perhaps a
          cow.  Some families raise pigs which are prolific breeders.
          Wealthier households own oxen and rent them for village work
          in exchange for food and labor.  Only the wealthiest of
          peasants can afford to keep a bull or a horse.
        </p>
        <p>
          Clothes should suit a person’s station.  A tunic, leggings,
          hat, and sandals are bare essentials.  Some folk wear a robe
          or gown instead of a tunic.  Travelers normally have a
          knapsack containing portable tools of their trade.  A
          weaponcrafter, for example, must own hammers and tongs, but
          carrying an anvil is unlikely.  Nearly everyone carries some
          fire-making tools (tinderbox, or flint and steel) and a
          strip of cloth for a towel, bandage, or arm-sling.  A
          waterskin is also essential.
        </p>
        <p>
          Nearly everyone owns a knife or dagger.  Clubs, bows,
          hatchets, slings, and staves are also common.  Other weapons
          are expensive and “Bearing Arms” in HârnPlayer should be
          consulted.  Few young adults can afford good armour.
          Military individuals are mostly equipped by their unit, but
          knights on feudal service must bring their own weapons,
          armour, and steed.
        </p>
        <p>
          Proving identity can be difficult on Hârn.  A travelling
          person should have papers to prove guild rank (if any)
          and/or a letter of introduction from a prominent person such
          as a lord of the manor, or a cleric or sheriff, etc.  Many
          guilds issue a badge or tattoo to prove rank. The expensive
          weapons and armour carried by knights speak for themselves.

        <h1 id="occupations">Occupations</h1>
        <p>
          An occupation largely determines the skills a person learns
          during adolescense and the opportunities that follow, at
          least initially.  Occupation is not necessarily a life
          commitment.  Jobs can change during a life, although this
          might involve lengthy re-training.  The occupations
          available depend mainly on Social Class, although birthplace
          and natural talent (attributes) may open or close some
          doors.  Some vocations (Knight and Herald) are only
          available to high-born individuals; some require exceptional
          natural talent.  Birthplace is also relevant; a person
          born in land-locked Kaldor may have a hard time running away
          to the sea.
        </p>
        <p>
          Determining the chances for the occupation of a random
          individual is hard, since no such census data is available.
          The outcome would largely depend on Social Class, which
          depends on the occupation of one’s parents. Some
          children follow the same occupation or choose another at GM
          discretion. The eldest born survivor, especially if a
          favorite, would be expected to follow the family
          occupation. Later born offspring have more choice,
          especially if unpopular. As a reference, the occupations a
          person can choose in Hârnic society are listed, with average
          income and years of apprenticeship.

          <em>Guilded Occupations:</em> Wages given are for Bonded
          Masters; room and board may also be provided.  The employer
          would bear the additional cost of providing materials and
          supplies, but tools are owned by the master.  A skilled
          mason-architect building a new castle, or an exquisite sword
          craftsman, could earn fees up to six times higher, but such
          incomes are rare.  Apprentices receive room &#0038; board
          and sometimes get pocket money from generous masters.
          Journeymen receive 30-60% of a master's wages, depending on
          experience, plus room and board.  Freemasters have variable
          incomes because demand for their services can vary.  See:

          <em>Unguilded Occupations:</em> Wages given are for average
          experienced workers; others might earn more/less depending
          on skills.  Wages are dependent on the availability of
          labor.  They also tend to be higher in summer and lower in
          winter.

          Occupational rating is on the typical five-star scale.  When
          completing an apprenticeship, a person is assumed to have
          advanced to &#9733;&#9733;&#9733; through his training.  The
          occupation of the parent will usually convey a &#9733;
          rating.  Attributes play a role in selecting a suitable
          profession.  There are practical and common sense limits.  A
          warrior with a sufficiently high Aura can certainly learn
          spells, but doing so requires years learning the mysteries
          and ways of magic.

          People interested in a clerical career must visit a temple
          or abbey to be interviewed by the Master of Acolytes, or
          find a priest to sponsor the application.  An appropriate
          Morality and a minimum Ritual knowledge are generally
          required, but a large donation to temple coffers may
          overcome a deficiency in talent.  Acolyte training takes
          seven years.  The church is a popular career for the second
          (or later) sons of nobility, or for devout characters of
          lesser birth.  The complex mysteries of church doctrine are
          described in <em>Religion</em>.
        </p>
        <p>
          Each church has holy scriptures written in a particular
          language and script: Churches teach this language and script
          to all Acolytes.  Three churches perform their ceremonies
          and rituals in a private (secret) language in addition to
          their church language.

          Newly ordained clerics start play knowing some Ritual
          Invocations.  All Common invocations rated at Circle II are
          taught to clerics.  Clerics may learn other invocations.
          Also see Religion.  Clerics usually complete their training
          with little of material value.  Acolytes are unpaid and the
          simple monastic life they lead in training does not
          encourage the accumulation of worldly goods.  Newly ordained
          clerics typically own a wool robe, linen tunic and hose,
          leather sandals or boots, a dagger or staff, a simple ring
          denoting their status, and a purse of 6-36 pence.

          Shek-Pvar belong to one of six ancient and esoteric
          sub-orders (convocations).  Each convocation stresses on
          certain Pvaric principles because some conflict with others.
          Most Hârnic Shek-Pvar reside in Melderyn.  Each convocation
          has its own chantries.  Chantries vary in quality according
          to a five-star scale.  The best are difficult to find and
          enter.  A high Aura is required, but most applicants can
          improve their chance of acceptance if they have the right
          family connections, sufficient funds to bestow, or an
          appropriate recommendation.

          When Mavari learn how to attune to their element, they are
          taught to let a small amount of Principle exist within their
          Aura.  Attunement must be done slowly and carefully, and it
          takes months before sufficient Principle can reside within
          the Aura to allow spells to be cast.  Mages refer to this
          Aura-resident Principle as their Foundation.  With time and
          practice, Foundations can be increased in size to
          accommodate Principle from other convocations.  A gifted
          Mavari will sometimes join a convocation in opposition to
          his Sunsign.  This gives him an advantage when learning
          spells of other convocations in the future, although it will
          impede his early career.  A Shek-Pvar Satia-Mavari departs
          from their chantry after five to seven years apprenticeship.
          Masters expect Mavari to spend the majority of their time
          learning spells of their own convocation.

          A military career provides good weapon skills, useful social
          contacts, and a good opportunity for advancement in society.
          Of course, it might also be dangerous.  Only individuals
          with good Strength, Stamina, and Will should consider this
          vocation.  The sunsigns Ahnu, Angberelius, and Aralius are

            squires.
          </p>
          <p>
            <em>Heavy Horse [HH]</em> The heavy cavalryman has
            well-padded mail from head to foot and may have
            strategically located plate.  He carries lance, sword, and
            shield, and usually other weapons as well.  Heavy horsemen
            are almost always noble and are primarily used as shock
            cavalry on the battlefield.
          </p>
          <p>
            <em>Shortbow [SB]</em> A light footman equipped with a
            shortbow, and bearing light melee weapons and a
            roundshield or buckler.
          </p>
          <p>
            <em>Longbow [LB]</em> A light footman equipped with a
            longbow.  Longbowmen require years of training and are
            quite rare.  They are well paid.
          </p>

          Because of the pervasive military influence of the Azeryan
          Empire, the Azeri names for military ranks are in common use
          throughout Northwestern Lythia.
        </p>
        <p>
          Five enlisted ranks are in general use.  These are rarely
          filled by nobles, who would consider them beneath their
          station.  <em>Molak:</em> the common soldier.  Status and
          remuneration vary according to special skills and unit type.
          <em>Arkalin:</em> commands a manus of five men; himself and
          four Molaks.  <em>Melbrin:</em> commands a decad of ten men;
          himself, one Arkalin, and eight Molaks.  <em>Molarin:</em>
          commands a company of twenty men; himself, one Melbrin, two
          Arkalins, and sixteen Molaks.  A cavalry Molarin commands a
          squadron.  <em>Armolarin:</em> the most senior Molarin in a
          centad.  He is the principal liaison between officers and
          men, and is often the “real” commander of a Centad.
        </p>
        <p>
          Officers are gentlemen.  A commoner rising to officer rank
          is also invariably knighted.  There is widespread belief
          that leaders must be noble, although there is no law to that
          effect.  Five officer ranks exist. <em>Hulhurin:</em> junior
          staff officer, and deputy commander of a Centad.  May also
          command an auxiliary company.  <em>Hethrin:</em> commander
          of a Centad, or a Cohort staff officer.  <em>Kurlin:</em>
          senior staff officer, and deputy commander of a Cohort.
          <em>Berheth:</em> commander of a Cohort.  <em>Tharin:</em>
          commander of a Legion, which has two or more Cohorts.
        </p>
        <p>
          Light horse units have the same ranks as infantry officers,
          except there is no Decad command.  Medium and Heavy horse
          units differ at Manus and Squadron level.
          <em>Chalisir:</em> any trooper in a medium or heavy horse
          unit.  A manus will be commanded by a senior Chalisir.
          <em>Kephiri:</em> commander of a Squadron of medium or heavy
          horse.
        </p>
        <p>
          Most units let individuals enlist at age 16, and discourage
          those over 30.  Interested individuals must contact a unit.
          The recruiting officer will ask about the person’s
          background, and military experience.  A recommendation from
          someone in the unit might be helpful, and some Knight units
          (including the Khuzdul High Guard) require applicants to be
          noble.
        </p>
        <p>
          Having completed four years of service, soldiers may now
          elect to continue their military career or muster-out of the
          army to follow some other occupation.  Guard and legionnaire
          units require a one year contract at the end of which a
          Re-enlistment Incentive may be offered to sign up for
          another twelve months.  Irregular units have less formal
          contracts, most likely just a handshake or an oath, but the
          effect is the same.

          Military wages are traditionally paid quarterly, but are
          listed monthly for comparison with other incomes.
          Considering the danger, wages are low, but armies offer
          various other benefits, and sometimes deliver them.  These
          include food and shelter, and the opportunity to collect
          booty.  The wage table gives monthly base pay.  Elite units
          may get more, although some elite units in which men serve
          for honor may get less.  It is not unusual for a soldier to
          work long stretches followed by long furloughs.  Armies are
          generous with (unpaid) leave in peacetime.  All foot units
          know the ranks Molak, Arkalin, Melbrin, Molarin, and
          Armolarin.  The pay listed is for Molaks, every next rank
          has a pay increase of 1/4 over the previous rank on the
          Molak’s base.  E.g. a Longbow Melbrin earns a monthly 108d.
          Light Horse units have the ranks Molak, Arkalin, Molarin,
          and Armolarin and progress 96d, 120d, 180d, and 216d.
          Medium and Heavy Horse units only have the ranks of Chalasir
          and Kephiri, of which the Kephiri earn +96d monthly over the
          base pay for Chalasirs.
        </p>
        <p>
          Traditionally, a soldier may keep 2/3 of booty collected,
          giving 1/3 to the next highest rank, who gives 1/3 to the
          next highest rank, and so on.  High ranking officers can get
          very rich with this scheme.  Cash bonuses are sometimes
          given for long, distinguished service, or as a re-enlistment
          incentive.  There is no typical amount, although a bonus
          would rarely exceed a month's pay.
        </p>
        <p>
          Standing armies typically offer land grants to soldiers
          after twenty years service.  Monetary pensions are rare, but
          “half-pay for life” might be awarded to a soldier who has
          distinguished himself in some way.  When a soldier is maimed
          in the course of duty, he is discharged with a lump sum
          bonus rather than a pension.  The amount is two to twelve
          months pay, depending on the nature of the injury and wealth
          of the unit.  Few armies provide survivor benefits.  A bonus
          of about six month's pay might be provided to a widow in
          exceptional cases.  More commonly, the deceased's comrades
          will make a collection.
        </p>

          A cohort, ideally, consists of two centads of light foot,
          one of medium foot and one of light footbowmen (shortbow or
          longbow).  In addition, there are often auxiliary units,
          such as companies of engineers (sappers), artillery (siege
          engines), light cavalry (scouts), medical, ostlers,
          weaponcrafters, etc.  In practice a Cohort may contain from
          two to six Centads, each consisting of two to eight
          Companies.  The economic realities of manning, equipping,
          and supporting military units have always overwhelmed the
          neat organizational plans of staff officers.  Each centad
          ideally has 100 men, grouped into 5 companies, lead by a
          Hethrin.  Each company consists of 2 decads and each decad
          has 2 manus.
        </p>
        <p>
          Some states, like Azeryan, group their cohorts into legions.
          The ideal Azeryani legion consists of four cohorts plus
          various auxiliary or reserve units attached to the legion
          HQ.  On Hârn, legions exist only in the Thardic Republic
          where they tend to be little more than large cohorts.
        </p>
        <p>
          Full strength cavalry cohorts are rare.  It is simply too
          expensive to maintain such units in peacetime.  The cohort
          shown, which exists only in the dreams of Lord Marshals,
          contains one centad of regular light horse, two centads of
          feudal medium horse, and one centad of feudal heavy horse.
          From mid-spring to mid-autumn, one or two squadrons of each
          feudal centad might be manned by knights doing their
          military service.  Other squadrons would be inactive until a
          military emergency arises.  Feudal units might be virtually
          devoid of personnel in winter.  Formally, a squadron
          consists of 10 riders, and is split into two manus.  Most
          cavalry tends to be deployed in small units of squadron or
          centad strength and massed only for battle.  There are, of
          course, exceptions, such as the large bodies of horse
          defending Shorkyne and Trierzon's borders.  Imperial cavalry
          tends to be mostly light.  Azeryan, for example, uses
          cavalry in a supporting role (scouts and skirmishers), as
          does Tharda.  This is mostly due to the lack of a feudal
          societal class.  The Azeryani do, however, hire foreign
          knights to serve in some special forces.  Logistical
          problems are different for cavalry units.  Auxiliary forces,
          weaponcrafters, ostlers, transport, engineers, and the like
          are all slower than cavalry, and tend to get left behind.
          Units, even small ones, may have their own “field
          households” (messes) in tow. These too, may straggle.

          Healing is a widely-practiced art.  Clerics of Peoni have
          considerable medical expertise.  Nearly all lay-folk,
          especially in rural areas, have some understanding of herbal
          remedies.  Most warriors know emergency treatments for
          battlefield wounds.
        </p>
        <p>
          Those who practice the healing arts full-time generally
          belong to the Society of Physicians, a loosely-organized
          guild.  The Society does not care much about preserving its
          monopoly, and makes little attempt to maintain standards.
          Some masters are incompetent quacks, while others are
          highly-skilled surgeons.  However, a physician who maims or
          kills too many patients will soon encounter difficulties
          from outraged friends and relatives.
        </p>
        <p>
          Master physicians may take on as many apprentices as they
          wish.  There are no journeymen in the Society, nor bonded
          masters in the normal sense; masters may take employment as
          they see fit.  Many masters are associated with the church
          of Peoni, and some dabble in the arcane arts.  Most
          physicians confine themselves to the treatment of minor
          ailments.  Fees vary dramatically, sometimes according to
          the skill brought to bear, but mostly according to
          reputation.  Fees typically range from 3d for fairly basic
          first aid to 240d for “major” surgery.  Medicines, provided
          by the Apothecaries’ Guild, and hospital care (rare) can
          double or triple fees.
        </p>
        <p>
          When people get sick or wounded, they are advised to get the
          best first aid available, and then seek someone with a
          decent Physician Mastery as soon as possible.  Carrying a
          good supply of bandages and herbal remedies is always a good
          idea.  Hârnic doctors are far more competent than their
          medieval Terran colleagues.  They know, for example, it’s a
          good idea to keep open wounds and surgical instruments as
          clean as possible, although they do not know why.  One
          theory has to do with fiery, invisible elementals which can
          be driven off with hot water.  If no doctor is available any
          friend can administer treatment and self-treatment is always
          possible (modified by Will at GM discretion).

        <h1 id="psi">Psionics</h1>
        <p>
          Psionic talents are native, psychic abilities some people
          possess, but may be unaware of.  Since it requires years of
          practice to properly employ Psionic talents, they are within
          the sphere of the Guild of Arcane Lore.  Those endowed may
          notice some of the odd effects produced by their latent
          Psionic abilities to &#9733; (one star on the five-star scale).
          Some learn of their ability when another person with a
          developed talent is able to sense and inform them of its
          presence.  Some talents are never discovered and remain
          dormant forever.  Individuals who wish to became a mage are
          more likely to be accepted as an apprentice if they have an
          active Psionic talent.
        </p>
        <p>
          Psionic Talents at &#9733; are dormant.  Anyone with a
          dormant talent is unaware of its existence.  No conscious
          development of dormant talents is possible.  However,
          exposure to powerful Psionic events or artifacts may
          stimulate a dormant talent.  Once the talent exceeds &#9733;, it
          becomes known to the person possessing it.  A dormant talent
          may reveal its nature with Psionic Episodes.  In later parts
          of the dormant stage, frequent Psionic episodes can lead to
          apprehensions that the person is insane, and may cause
          well-meaning observers to attempt cures or confinement.
          This can be awkward when the person does not know the cause
          of the problem.
        </p>
        <p>
          Once a talent develops past the dormant stage, it may be
          developed more or less normally.  The individual must
          meditate (not sleep!) for at least 8 hours of a day to gain
          new insights.  Anyone with an active Psionic talent can
          attempt to use it at anytime, provided the person is
          conscious.  Using Psionic talents is tiring, regardless,
          whether or not the attempt is successful.  Fatigue can also
          be accumulated after a Psionic episode.  Particularly
          stressing invocations may cause the invoker to fall
          unconscious and also suffers Psionic Blindness, the complete
          inability to use any Psionic talent, for several hours.
          Sometimes unpredictable and/or unanticipated results may
          occur when invoking a Psionic talent.  Possibilities for
          misfires are given in the talent descriptions.  Psionic
          episodes occur randomly but are more likely, when a talent
          is used often or for extended periods of time.
        </p>
        <p>
          Medium, Prescience, and Sensitivity are talents which may be
          stimulated by appropriate phenomena, which is called passive
          triggering.  Medium may be triggered by the presence of
          ethereals, Prescience by imminent danger, and Sensitivity by
          a Psionic or magical residue/effect.  If the stimulus is
          weak, the person is less likely to be alerted.  When
          passive triggering occurs, the owner is given minimal
          information.  If the person wants more information, the
          talent must be used actively (with fatigue being a
          consequence).
        </p>
        <p>
          Two people with the same Psionic talent may wish to pool
          their efforts in invoking the talent.  This may be done if
          skin contact is established by grasping hands, etc. and skin
          contact is maintained during the time spent invoking the
          talent.  Under unknown circumstances ritual procedure may
          need to be followed in order to form the necessary “fusion”
          between invokers.  This will become known to the affected
          invokers instinctively.
        </p>
        <p>
          The following talents are known by the guild.  No percentages
          are given, because talents are too rare to gather sufficient
          statistics.  While Psionics are more instinctive than
          spells, concepts such as Spellfire Timing, Modeling,
          Detection, Noise, and Foci, all have application.

          A Psionic talent to influence the mind of another person
          (victim).  The usual effect is to “freeze” the victim in
          place for a limited period of time. In order to invoke the
          talent successfully, eye contact between the invoker and the
          victim is necessary, but only for a momentary glance. The
          maximum distance at which effective eye contact can occur is
          approximately 10 yards.  The effect remains in place until
          the attacker stops gazing at the victim.

          The ability to visualize events currently occurring at a
          remote location.  A target may sense the attention of a
          clairvoyant.  The psychic enters a trance and after the
          first minute gets a clear image of some object, person, or
          location that he is familiar with.  The image may be moving
          and is of the current state.  Sensory perception is normal
          but with narrow focus on the object.  Clairvoyance may be
          used in either of two ways: <em>Near:</em> The clairvoyant
          enters a trance to transfer their point of perception to a
          location.  The location must be familiar to the clairvoyant.
          <em>Far:</em> The clairvoyant enters a trance sand attempts
          to focus on a specific, remote person or object whose
          location may not be known.  The clairvoyant does this by
          visualizing the person’s face (or by describing the object).
          There are no range restrictions, but there is also no chance
          to listen or smell.

            <em>Psionic Episodes:</em> Sleepwalking, dreams of

        <p>
          The ability to detach the ethereal spirit from the body,
          which is left in a state of metabolic suspension.  The
          disembodied spirit is referred to as an astral entity.
          Information about the abilities of astral entities is in
          Religion.  It is difficult to remain in a disembodied state
          for long.  The talent lasts for several minutes, after which
          the astral entity instantly returns to its body (even if it
          does not want to return).  If the body is vacant when the
          astral entity returns, it reunites with its body and a Shock
          Roll is then made.  If the body has been occupied by another
          ethereal while the astral entity was away, Mental Conflict
          occurs.  Disembodiment is achieved by making one’s body very
          relaxed (somewhat similar to how one falls asleep).  The
          time needed to invoke the talent is one minute.

          <p>
            <em>Restoration:</em> An attempt to remove fatigue.
            Remove fatigue from the “victim” at a seemingly random
            rate.  The fatigue is accrued by the talent user at the
            normal rate.

        <p>
          Sometimes called “the evil eye,” Hex is the ability to
          “curse” a victim, causing them to have bad luck.  If the
          invoker has a part of the victim (nail parings, lock of
          hair, etc.) increase Mastery.  Such items cannot be used
          more than once.  At the time the talent is invoked, the
          maximum distance between the invoker and the intended victim
          depends on whether the invoker has a part of the victim.  If
          a part is available, the maximum distance is a league.  If a
          part is unavailable, the maximum distance is line of sight.
          The psychic enters a trance and after the first minute
          reduces the victims rolls by his talent skill level.  The
          person may be moving.

            any ethereal within earshot.
          </p>
          <p>
            <em>Summon:</em> An attempt to summon an ethereal
            currently perceived by the invoker, or whose true name is
            known.  This results in a Mental Conflict.  Knowing the
            “true name” is beneficial to the talent user.

            <em>Control:</em> An attempt to command an ethereal the
            invoker has summoned.  Another Mental Conflict must be
            won.  Some ethereals are beyond control.  With a win, the
            ethereal may be commanded to perform a simple task such as
            answer a yes/no question truthfully within its knowledge,

          The invoker enters a trance for 10 seconds and if

          but may be dissolved instantly by its creator.  The field
          requires great concentration to maintain; the invoker is in

          be symbolic in nature.  Folklore may be used to interpret
          the vision.  Some clerics and divinators specialize in
          interpretation of prescient visions.  There are two active
          forms:
        </p>
        <div class="explain">
          <p>
            <em>Prescient Vision:</em> The invoker specifies the
            subject of inquiry.  The invoker enters a trance for one
            hour, during which a prescient vision occurs concerning
            the subject.  Mastery is reduced if the subject is hidden
            by magic, etc.  Normally, the invoker lacks control over
            the vision, but with &#9733;&#9733;&#9733;&#9733; or
            above, it is possible to direct the inquiry somewhat.
            Prescience can only reveal likely future events; the
            future may be altered.  The trance does not cause fatigue.
          </p>
          <p>
            <em>Sense of Danger:</em> An attempt to assess danger in a
            specific location.  The invoker enters a trance for about
            a minute.  If successful, this gives a vague feeling of
            danger if there are traps or lurking dangers within an
            area that could reasonably be reached/accessed within the
            time frame the trance lasts.  This trance causes fatigue.

          The ability to divine information about persons by touching
          an object with which they have been in contact.  Psychometry
          requires the invoker to hold the object and enter a trance
          for a few minutes.  Psychometry is most often used to divine
          the age or history of an object, the identity of the
          object's maker or owners, magical/divine powers, etc.
          Another use is to determine a person’s location.
        </p>
        <p>
          Psychometry can never be used to divine the future.  It
          works best when queries concern the present or recent past.
          Mastery is reduced for inquiries in the distant past, or if
          knowledge of the object is magically or divinely hidden.
          The longer the vision lasts, the more information is
          obtained.  A reasonable minimum is 5 minutes. (Accrues

          the fire takes a long as it takes to throw an imaginary fire
          to the target.  It takes a bit longer when the object is
          chilled or wet.  Once the object begins to burn, the invoker
          has no control over the fire.  The talent may be used to
          warm objects to a desired temperature less than flash point,

          The power to transmit thoughts or emotions to the mind of

          attempted; the target’s location does not need to be known
          by the invoker.  Someone who receives an emotion will feel
          it – this can have an interesting effect.  If a person with
          the Sensitivity talent is near the target or the invoker at

          the same size as the invoker.  The invoker acquires the
          physical attributes of the target form, but retains his own

          A few scholars may argue that the gods are figments of the
          imaginations of men, but most Lythians believe implicitly in
          their existence.  Hârnic society is pregnant with divine
          superstition.  In addition to the ten major deities,
          hundreds of lesser semi-divine entities are worshiped by
          Lythians.  The powers of the deities, if not infinite, are
          beyond the compass of mortals.  Demigods, on the other hand,
          are closer to humankind; their imperfections and weaknesses,
          their attitudes and objectives, may at least be comprehended
          by mortals.  Demigods are of two types: those who serve one
          of the ten great deities by choice or compulsion, and those
          who serve no master.  They vary in strength and attitude.
          Some demigods are confined to specific regions by greater
          beings or principles, some are associated with particular
          peoples or institutions, and some are semi-legendary mortal
          heroes.  A demon is simply a demigod one believes to be
          evil.

          Each of the ten major deities have mortal adherents who have
          created religious institutions to regulate and foster their
          version of the truth.  The organization of churches vary
          greatly.  Each is detailed in the separate deity articles,
          but a few generalities can be made.  All churches have a
          clergy and laity although a few, like the Church of Naveh,
          almost totally ignore the latter.  Some laity may be
          extremely pious, but they will not be taught the higher
          rituals of the church.  The clergy are the priests and
          priestesses, those who organize and administer the temples
          and devote their lives to serving the deity.  Although often
          simple folk by birth, clerics enjoy a privileged social
          status between that of guildsmen and the nobility.  All
          churches of the ten major deities have ceremonial levels of
          knowledge called Circles of Command.  Most churches have
          seven Circles, although those without Pontiffs have only
          six.  The table below indicates offices a member of that
          Circle is qualified to hold.

          Those baptized in a faith are automatically I. Circle.
          Those entering the church as a career are admitted to the
          II. Circle.  Clerics are admitted to the III. Circle when
          they are ordained.  Admission to higher Circles require
          approval of at least three existing members of the desired
          Circle.  This may occur soon, or it can be delayed by years
          of political intrigue.  Churches appoint members of the
          clergy to permanent or temporary offices.  All promotions
          are controlled by those with higher office, except the
          highest office is usually the result of election by peers.
          In some churches the offices of Archbishop, Primate, and
          Pontiff are (effectively) restricted to clerics of noble
          blood.  People may apply for appointment to any vacant
          church office for which their current Circle qualifies them.
          Appointments are handled solely at GM discretion; a
          candidate’s Intrigue and Social Class are always
          significant.
        </p>
        <p>
          Most churches contain one or more clerical orders and most
          clerics are members of a specific order.  The lay followers
          of a deity are not required to join any particular clerical
          order, but those with martial skill often belong to fighting
          orders which are sponsored by various clerical orders.
          Clerical and fighting orders have their own hierarchies.
          Morality is a crucial attribute for clerics.  Although
          church officials may be unaware of a person’s true
          Morality, deities are not so easily fooled.  Clerics
          entering a church for which their Morality is inappropriate
          are unlikely to prosper, or even live very long.  Circles
          are ceremonial ranks, whereas offices are political ranks.
          Higher circles are evidence of a certain level of knowledge,
          but in no way guarantee promotion to higher office.  A High
          Priest is a member of at least the IV. Circle, but most
          members of the IV. Circle are simple priests.  Although
          rare, there have been cases where a VII. Circle pontiff
          retired to end his days as a simple abbey priest.
        </p>
        <p>
          Legally recognized churches have the right to hold their own
          courts and administer justice for a variety of religious
          crimes, including blasphemy, heresy, and witchcraft.  Temple
          courts often use trial by ordeal to determine guilt or
          innocence.  The penalties handed out vary from one church to
          another; Peonian courts rarely inflict permanent harm on
          offenders, but Agrikan courts are fond of burning at the
          stake.  Temple courts must obtain secular consent to any
          death penalties, a formality often ignored by some churches.
          For more information, see HârnPlayer.
        </p>
        <p>
          There is corruption in every church.  Most churches argue
          that their clerics are infallible, but corrupt ones will be
          punished in the afterlife.  This may be of small comfort to
          a cleric who is roasted alive on false charges of heresy.
          The piety and ritual rules allow clerics to perform ritual
          invocations without piety, although pious priests can do
          them better.
        </p>
        <p>
          The fragmentation of the churches resulting from pantheism
          weakens their universal influence, but their power in
          specific regions, or among some economic groups is
          significant.  The churches of Larani and Peoni dominate in
          the kingdoms of Chybisa, Kaldor, Kanday, and Melderyn.  The
          church of Agrik is prominent in the Kingdom of Rethem.
          Adherents of Save-K’nor tend to be scholars with influence
          throughout Hârn, on Melderyn in particular.  Sarajinism is
          the dominant faith of the Ivinian conquerors of Orbaal,
          while Ilvir holds some sway among their subject Jarin.  Siem
          is primarily worshiped by the Khuzdul and Sindarin, although
          each race tends to focus their faith through one of two
          demigod servants.  Halea has support from merchants and
          guildsmen in all states, but is most dominant in the Thardic
          Republic.  The churches of Morgath and Naveh have few
          adherents; both are proscribed and covert throughout most of
          Hârn, except the Church of Morgathm which has enormous
          influence in Golotha, the principal city of Rethem.

        <h3 id="piety">Piety</h3>
        <p>
          Piety is a unit of favor with a deity and religious zeal.
          People accrue Piety by performing actions publicly
          beneficial to their deity.  They expend them by publicly
          committing a sin.  Piety may also be used to increase the
          Mastery of any skill of Prayer.  Piety is dedicated to a
          single deity.  Individuals can, if they wish, maintain
          separate Piety totals for two or more deities.  Multiple
          worship is rare, especially among clerics.  Most folk fear
          this will compromise the passage of their soul when they
          die.  Remember that a major sin to Larani, might be viewed
          by Agrik as commendable.  Also remember that the viewpoint
          of a church and its deity may differ; an overzealous or
          corrupt priest might declare an action to be a major sin,
          but a deity might not agree.  Adherents of churches that
          hear confessions may be able to avoid some penalties, but
          penances are often imposed, especially on ordained clerics.
          Some people are said to have Divine Grace.  Divine Grace has
          the following important effects:
        </p>
        <p>
          Individuals with Divine Grace are deemed “worthy” of divine
          aid, and individuals without Divine Grace are “unworthy.”
          Hence, a call for divine intervention is more likely to
          succeed for those with Divine Grace.  Invocations that heal
          injuries, cure diseases, remove curses, etc., have a Special
          Bonus if the subject has Divine Grace.
          A person without Divine Grace will have difficulty
          convincing a deity to claim his spirit when he dies, forcing
          it to wonder the worlds as a shade, or to negotiate with
          another deity for acceptance.
        </p>
        <div class="explain">
          <p>
            <em>Prayer.</em> One uninterrupted hour of prayer and/or
            meditation in an appropriate temple or on other
            consecrated ground.
          </p>
          <p>
            <em>Fasting.</em> A full day (24 hours) of fasting, which
            cannot include any other activity except prayer, sleep,
            etc.  Note: starving is not fasting; individuals must make
            a conscious decision not to eat when food is available.
          </p>
          <p>
            <em>Confession.</em> The churches of Halea, Larani,
            Morgath, Naveh, Peoni, and Save-K’nor hear confessions.
            Only confessions of “significant guilt” are worthy of
            piety.  Confessions must be made to an ordained cleric who
            (80% chance) may demand a penance.
          </p>
          <p>
            <em>Daily Mass.</em> Attendance at the daily church
            service held by most temples.  Daily Mass is generally
            held in the early evening and lasts one or more hours.
            Services may be attended by anyone.
          </p>
          <p>
            <em>Monthly Low Mass.</em> Most churches hold a special
            monthly Low Mass for the laity.  The day varies by church.
            There is no Daily Mass on this day.
          </p>
          <p>
            <em>Monthly High Mass.</em> Most churches hold a monthly
            High Mass which may be attended only by the clergy.  The
            day varies by church; most have one day a month they
            consider more holy than any other.
          </p>
          <p>
            <em>Feast Mass.</em> Held yearly on the principal holy
            day, this mass often lasts four hours.  It is usually
            followed by second service open only to clerics.  There is
            no High Mass or Daily Mass on this day.  A “feaster” is a
            name given to adherents who attend only the Feast Mass –
            it is a derogatory term.
          </p>
          <p>
            <em>Temple Service.</em> Some people perform a minor
            task for the temple, such as cleaning out the storerooms
            or latrines.  The service usually takes a couple of days
            to perform.  Piety accrual is on completion and may vary
            with the difficulty (or unpleasantness) of the task.
          </p>
          <p>
            <em>Donation/Sacrifice.</em> People may make donations to
            temples or sacrifices to their deity.  A sacrifice must be
            appropriate to the deity.  Siem, for example, would cast
            out anyone who sacrificed a life; Morgath would be very
            pleased.  Something of high value to the individual will
            probably be more favored by the deity.
          </p>
          <p>
            <em>Quest.</em> Adherent agrees to perform a task in the
            service of a church and/or deity.  Individuals who
            willingly abandon the task before completion lose piety.
          </p>
          <p>
            <em>Pilgrimage.</em> Adherent undertakes a journey to a
            holy site of the deity.  Piety granted reflects the
            distance and danger involved.  Because the ways of deities
            are incomprehensible to mortals, the piety for any act may
            seem random.

        <h3 id="intervent">Divine Intervention</h3>
        <p>
          The motives of the gods vary.  The kind of universe desired
          by Morgath, the Lord of Chaos, is different from that wanted
          by Peoni, the gentle patron of healing.  The problem all ten
          gods face is that they cannot destroy each other without
          risking all their destructions.  Hence, the Concordat limits
          the actions that may be taken.  Conflict between the gods is
          now more or less confined to the mortal and semi-mortal
          planes of Kethira and Yashain.  Siem has withdrawn to the
          Blessed Realm, and Ilvir broods alone at Araka-Kalai.
          Halea, Naveh, Save-K’nor, and Sarajin have established their
          neutrality, although each favors varying degrees of order
          and chaos.  Peoni is effectively a non-combatant.  Larani
          stands, essentially alone, against Morgath and Agrik.  These
          two evil deities have not formed an alliance, but it is
          their works that Larani tries to undo.  These divisions are
          not simply based on morality.  The quasi-war between Larani
          and the dark pair is more complex than a simple epic.
          Agrik, and especially Morgath, represent a degree of chaos,
          a breaking down of order that would greatly change the
          worlds.  To prevent total chaos, and enforce the Concordat,
          the other gods support Larani to survive, but not to win.
          To prevent all-out war, there is a Concordat limiting the
          interference of deities in the affairs of lesser
          beings. Although mortals cannot know the truth or nature of
          these limits, the following principles, hotly debated by
          theologians, have evolved to justify the limitations of the
          gods.  These principles are not always followed precisely by
          the deities, are often violated by demigods, and certainly
          do not apply to mortal adherents.

            <em>Principle of Transpotence:</em> Since there is more

          Divine Intervention is an attempt to enlist the aid of a
          deity to perform a miracle.  Interventions are implemented
          by gods; if they choose to respond at all, they decide what
          to do.  A deity may be open to suggestion, but will not take
          kindly to demands.  A person may call for Divine
          Intervention at any time.  A call for intervention may be
          anything from, “Please help us out of this terrible mess” to
          “Please tell me the contents of this box.”  There are no
          limits, just consequences.  An individual calling for Divine
          Intervention must have at least &#9733; Piety for that deity.
          Each deity has a base chance of 20% to intervene. (These
          statistics are collected by the individual churches and are
          <em>highly</em> subjective and significantly favor their own
          deity.  Still, the average across all ten major deities is
          presented.  The data should therefore be taken with a pound
          of salt.)  Piety from two or more individuals may be
          combined; each may make a separate call.  Calls that are
          trivial or unethical (for that deity) are always unworthy.
          Conversely, a call to do something the deity would probably
          want anyway is more likely to succeed and worthy.  Note:
          Ritual skill plays no part in Divine Intervention. A pious
          layman has more chance of Divine Intervention than an
          impious cleric of high ritual.  Deities are averse to
          leaving direct evidence of their actions or even of their
          existence.  When a deity intervenes, it is generally
          impossible to prove an intervention has actually occurred.
          Virtually any intervention can be explained away as just as
          coincidence, the normal workings of nature, etc.
        </p>
        <p>
          If the call for intervention succeeds, a 60% chance is
          estimated for the deity to impose conditions for the aid.
          The caller is given a task to fulfill in exchange for the
          intervention.  Such tasks vary from minor services that must
          be undertaken within a year.  Any condition and
          non-compliance penalty depend on the deity, the importance
          of the intervention, and so on.  Refusal to fulfill a
          Condition is unwise.
        </p>
        <p>
          If the call for intervention fails, a 20% chance is
          estimated to see if the deity exacts some kind of
          Retribution on the caller.  If a retribution occurs the
          deity not only fails to help, but also inflicts some curse
          or penance.
        </p>
        <p>
          A call to a demigod increases the chance of Intervention by
          10, but also increases the chance of Conditions by 20, or
          the chance of Retribution by 10.  Individuals may pray in
          the hope of gaining the favor of their deity for any
          endeavor.  Prayers take between one second and one minute
          usually. The effect is to increase the Mastery in some skill
          by a few points. Success varies with time and piety
          involved.

        <h3 id="ethereals">Ethereals</h3>
        <p>
          Between this world (Kethira) and the next (Yashain) stands a
          shadowy “half world” known by many names, but most often as
          the Astral Plane or the Spirit World.  Ethereals are
          spiritual entities, capable of existing on this Astral
          Plane, and moving between it and Kethira or Yashain.
          Kethira, Yashain, and the Astral Plane all exist in the same
          or nearby physical space.  Passing through solid objects by
          an Ethereal is called “frooshing.”  For many ethereals, this
          is unpleasant and/or tiring.  A corporeal creature
          “frooshed” by an ethereal usually experiences an eerie,
          shivering sensation.
        </p>
        <div class="explain">
          <p>
            <em>Astrals.</em> An astral is a disembodied spirit,
            typically created by the use of the Disembodiment Psionic
            talent or the Transcendence ritual invocation.  An astral
            maintains strong empathy with its own body because it must
            leave at least a portion of its Aura behind to avoid
            death.  Because of this link, an astral entity always
            knows the distance and direction to its native body, and
            is always aware of any in the status of that body.  A
            vacated body is comatose in a state of metabolic
            suspension.  The body is subject to normal physical injury
            and can die during the absence of its astral.  Should this
            occur, the resident and astral portions of Aura will
            immediately dissolute and reform as one entity in double
            the normal time.  An astral may return and repossess its
            own (living) body without difficulty, but fatigue is
            accumulated in the ethereal state.  An astral may also
            return to find its body has been possessed by an alien
            spirit.
          </p>
          <p>
            <em>Shades (Ghosts).</em> A shade is created when: The
            physical body of an astral traveler dies; a person dies
            without Divine Grace and the spirit is unclaimed by any of
            the gods; a person dies in circumstances which require a
            “great wrong” to be righted before the spirit can “rest.”
            A shade may wander the world(s), but most often haunts the
            scene of its death until the “great wrong” is righted, or
            they are admitted to an afterlife by one of the gods.
          </p>
          <p>
            <em>Natural Ethereals.</em> These are entities whose
            natural state is ethereal.  They originate on the Astral
            Plane, most often by powerful sorcery or divine will, but
            may have a physical form on some other plane.  Divine and
            semi-divine entities are natural ethereals, as are most
            elementals.  Some entities are able to de-materialize
            their physical bodies and become entirely ethereal by an
            act of will, or by arcane means.  De-materialization has
            the advantage of avoiding the risks of leaving a body
            behind while the spirit travels.  This ability is evidence
            for the view, held by many scholars, that the mortal body
            is simply a convenient physical manifestation of the
            immortal Aura.  This theory, if true, means that all
            creatures are really natural ethereals because their
            immortal state is ethereal.

          Although usually referred to in the singular, the Astral
          Plane is really an almost infinite number of shifting and
          overlapping planes.  Although movement between astral planes
          is almost instantaneous, only divine entities can hope to
          navigate this “ethereal maze” with any degree of speed or
          accuracy.
        </p>
        <p>
          Ethereals have no physical attributes and cannot see, hear,
          smell, touch, or taste things in a physical sense.  They
          possess only non-physical attributes and abilities,
          including spells and invocations.  Ethereals have the
          Psionic talents of Telepathy and Sensitivity.  They are able
          to directly perceive and communicate with each other, and
          with a corporeal entity bearing these talents.  Their
          sensitivity to Aura also allows them to view all living
          things as a hazy image, day or night.  When moving on the
          same plane, astrals and shades travel as a fast runner would
          and pass through solid objects at will - which is fortunate
          since they cannot see any Aura-less objects.  Natural
          ethereals, especially if winged, can generally move faster
          than this.
        </p>
        <p>
          Ethereals are not subject to physical fatigue, but may
          accrue mental fatigue by using spells or Psionic talents. An
          ethereal may only use talents or spells which do not involve
          physical action on its part.  All Masteries while
          disembodied are subject to fatigue.  Ethereals cannot be
          destroyed.  They are immune to injury except when inflicted
          by enchanted weapons, magic, Psionic talents, or divine
          intervention.  If subjected to esoteric harm, injury is
          translated into fatigue.  Ethereals cannot recover fatigue
          except by dissolution.  Dissolution is the scattering of an
          ethereal’s “substance.”  It reforms in several hours at the
          location of the ethereal’s physical body (if it has one),
          otherwise in a random location or plane.  When the process
          is complete, the ethereal regains consciousness and has no
          fatigue.
        </p>
        <p>
          The natural state of ethereals is invisible.  They can
          become translucent at will, but doing so accrues normal
          Fatigue per minute.  This accumulation of fatigue does not
          by itself cause dissolution, but will increase the
          ethereal’s susceptibility to dissolution.  An ethereal may
          possess a live body by winning a mental conflict with the
          resident Aura.  Possession is easier if part of the native
          Aura is absent as an astral.  A possessed body acquires the
          personality attributes of the invading spirit, while
          physical attributes are unchanged.  All disembodied
          inidviduals have Telepathy and Sensitivity Psionic talents
          during their ethereal state. These talents are dormant in
          all creatures with Aura.  Kethira, Yashain, and the Astral
          Planes all exist in the same or nearby physical space.
          Movement between these planes is almost instantaneous,
          assuming the traveler knows the paths to take which is never
          easy given the ever-shifting nature of the Astral planes.
          An ethereal move applies only to movement on the same plane.
          The risk of having a stranger establish squatter’s rights in
          the “temple of one’s body” is one of the greater hazards of
          astral travel.  From an astral’s perspective, this is akin
          to breaking into someone’s house, eating the food, drinking
          the wine, trying on the clothes, beating the servants, and
          bedding the spouse.  A vanquished native spirit may attempt
          to regain its own body with a new Mental Conflict after the
          normal period of Dissolution.  An ongoing struggle between
          the invading and native spirit may cause further personality
          switches.  Ethereals may also possess the body of a recently
          dead creature, thus creating a Zombie.

        <h3 id="afterlife">Afterlife</h3>
        <p>
          Each person has a soul, the non-physical portion of the
          person.  When the body dies, the soul journeys to its
          afterlife.  Most people commit their soul to one god who
          takes possession of the soul upon death.  Those who die
          godless, or out of Divine Grace with their god, embark on a
          Death Journey unless “saved” by a funeral rite.  All clerics
          are taught Passage of the Soul, a funeral ritual to help a
          soul make a swift journey to its afterlife.  Although
          funerals vary from church to church and from region to
          region, the basic pattern is the same; a priest of shaman
          performs the ritual to get the attention of the god.  Then
          the priest orchestrates a prayer (often sung) to confer a
          state of Divine Grace upon the deceased by gathering Piety
          from the attendees.  Those who do not attain sufficient
          piety for Divine Grace are on their own as they make the
          Death-Journey.

        <p>
          Spells and ritual invocations should never be confused.
          Clerics seek to draw the deity’s attention by performing a
          ritual, and encourage intervention by limiting the call to a
          specific effect but, ultimately, they depend on their deity
          to act.  Spellcasting, on the other hand, involves powers
          released by a mage from the fundament of Kelestia and
          requires no divine intervention.  Mages are generally
          offended by any suggestion that a spell is miraculous.
          Conversely, any claim that a ritual invocation is a spell
          would be construed by most clerics as an admission of
          blasphemy.
        </p>
        <p>
          Ritual is a skill which reflects an individual’s knowledge of
          church dogma, holy scriptures, chants, songs, and mysteries.
          There is a separate Ritual Skill for each deity.  It is used
          by clerics for performing ritual invocations.  Individuals
          may, theoretically, have Ritual for two or more deities.
          Learning Rituals assumes the individual in question has
          received some basic instruction in the church mysteries and
          been baptized into the faith.  Ritual Mastery can only be
          improved by learning new invocations, reading Holy Tomes, or
          performing an invocation in an adverse situation or in
          ritual church duty.
        </p>
        <p>
          Ritual invocations are ceremonies that “encourage” a deity
          to intervene with a miracle.  They originated as a means for
          clerics to impress their laity or potential converts.  These
          uses are still practiced, but many invocations work equally
          well (often better) to subdue those who oppose a cleric’s
          deity.  Such use is tacitly approved by all churches, since
          the “proxy wars” of mortals is an acceptable method of
          conflict among deities.  Theoretically, anyone may learn the
          rituals of any Circle, but most churches will teach them
          only to ordained priests.  The rituals were once closely
          associated with a specific circle, higher rituals being the
          exclusive knowledge of higher circles.  They are still
          classified in this way, but “leakage” of knowledge over the
          centuries has eroded this restriction.  Today, the
          invocations of any Circle can be taught to any ordained
          priest.
        </p>
        <p>
          People may perform any invocation they know.
          Invocations can be learned in one of three ways: from a
          mentor, from holy scriptures, or by divine revelation.
        </p>

            from another cleric who knows it.  Both the student and
            mentor must be fluent (&#9733;&#9733;&#9733;) in a shared language.
          </p>
          <p>
            <em>Holy Scriptures.</em> There are a wide variety of holy
            writings, parables, songs, poems, and teachings that can
            be thought of as Holy Scriptures.  Church archives are
            filled with such written works and clerics consult them to
            expand their knowledge of dogma and ritual.  Invocations
            can be learned from Holy Scriptures if they are written in
            a known language and script, or a reliable translator must
            be available.
          </p>
          <p>
            <em>Divine Revelation.</em> In rare cases, a deity may
            wish to provide knowledge of an invocation to any
            adherent, perhaps even a lay adherent.  Such revelations
            are handled at GM discretion, but are only likely to occur
            if an individual succeeds on a Divine Intervention roll.
          </p>
        </div>
        <p>
          To learn an invocation, a person must spend 5 days per
          Circle. That is, for a III Circle invocation, a person
          spends 15 days. (The number of watches it takes is 45.)
        </p>
        <p>
          It should not be assumed that clerics are the only people
          with access to ritual invocations.  The Morgathian Prophet
          Balsha, for example, received no formal training in the
          tenets of the Morgathian Church, yet miracles were invoked
          in his presence.  Most clerics feel a prophet appears when a
          church needs to be steered away from a path of action which
          does not please its deity.  Of course, one person’s prophet
          is another person’s heretic.
        </p>
        <p>
          Temples are always consecrated ground, and certain areas
          such as crypts and graveyards can be made holy to a specific
          deity by the ritual invocation Consecration.  Peoni and
          Larani are allied and oppose Agrik.  Morgath, the Lord of
          Chaos, opposes everyone, but can be, in some circumstances,
          “allied” with Agrik.  All other gods are neutral, but tend
          to favor Peoni and Larani.  An invocation call usually
          consists of a quick prayer or chant, but can involve (if
          time permits) construction of an altar, burning of incense,
          an appropriate sacrifice, etc.  The intent is to perform a
          ritual which is less likely to annoy the deity.  It is said
          the powers of Naveh and Morgath arise at night and slumber
          in the light, and those of Sarajin are highest amid ice and
          snow.

          Each dose requires the ritual to be 5 minutes long; one

          chance for the Ritual skill mastery.  Each volume requires

          <em>Holy Artifact:</em> a consecrated artifact, typically a

          Artifacts store a known invocation for instant activation on
          command.  Cleric determines the number of charges to install
          – each charge takes a casting time of 5 minutes times the
          Circle.  Hence, storing three charges of a Circle V
          invocation cost 3 x 5 x 5 = 75 minutes.  Use of an artifact
          generally requires some sort of triggering or activation.
          Most often, this is done by speaking (or thinking of) a
          particular key word or phrase.  Invoking the ritual requires
          comparing piety against 5 times the Circle embedded.

          location may already have been sanctified to another deity.
          The casting time is 2 minutes for each square yard to be
          consecrated.  The area to be consecrated must be walked upon
          during the ritual.  Any version of the ritual must be
          completed within one watch.

          May only be performed on a subject of the same religion who
          has lesser rank and Circle.  Strips the subject of rank and
          responsibilities within the church and notifies the deity
          that the subject is out of favor.  Deity might not agree
          with the action and may, especially in cases of impiety or
          corruption, penalize the invoker instead.  Circle reduction
          is as far as the caster is authorized to invoke by the
          church.

          Physical conflict is an important aspect of Hârnic culture.
          The following compilation is an extract and modernization of
          the anonymous treatise <em>The Colloquium of the Four
          Veterans</em>.  It is clear that the author must have
          witnessed several of the recent Hârnic wars and extensive
          knowledge of conflicts with barbarian tribes.  Only the
          essence of this four volume treatise is captured here.  It
          is treasured among scholars.
        </p>
        <h3 id="combat-data">Combat Data</h3>
        <p>
          <em>Weapon:</em> Some weapons are restricted by region,
          race, and custom.  (C) Chivalric (noble) Weapon; (T)
          Tool/Peasant weapon; (M) Also missile weapon, data given
          here is for use as Melee weapon, for use as Missile weapon
          see later; (R) Rare Weapon (on Hârn); (G) Gargun Weapon; (S)
          Sindarin Weapon; (L) Long Weapon.  Attacks at 5 foot range
          and cannot Attack closer.
        </p>
        <p>
          <em>Skill:</em> Combat Skill to use the weapon.
        </p>
        <p>
          <em>WT:</em> Weight of the weapon in pounds.  Trace items
          (arrows, slingstones, etc) are presumed to weigh 0.1 pounds
          each.
        </p>
        <p>
          <em>WQ:</em> Weapons are rated for quality.  Sturdy
          all-metal weapons like swords have higher ratings than
          hafted weapons like spears.  WQ represents the chance a
          weapon breaks in certain combat situations.  Higher quality
          weapons cost more.
        </p>
        <p>
          <em>HM:</em> Hand Mode penalties.  All weapons, except Bows
          and Blowguns, can be used one-handed.  There is no bonus for
          two-handed use, but some weapons are penalized when used
          one-handed.  Unless a person is ambidextrous, all weapons
          (except Shields) used in the secondary hand (left hand for
          most) also have a Hand Mode Special Penalty.
        </p>
        <p>
          <em>B/E/P:</em> The impact (damage) of a weapon when it
          strikes.  Weapons may have impact ratings for two or three
          Aspects: Blunt (B), Edge (E), and Point (P).  A - rating
          indicates the weapon does not have this Aspect.  A zero (0)
          rating means the weapon has the Aspect, but impact is +0.
          Point aspects in brackets are optional; if chosen, WQ is
          reduced by one (1).  This is a “weapon-build” option.
        </p>
        <p>
          <em>Price:</em> The retail price for average quality
          weapons.  Higher quality weapons roughly double in price for
          each addition point in WQ.  The source for weapons is a
          Weaponcrafter, except F (Fletcher), H (Hideworker), M
          (Metalsmith), or W (Woodcrafter).  Individuals with related
          craft skills can make/repair their own weapons, but rarely
          with WQs as high as listed.

          Armour can be defined as any article of clothing capable of
          reducing the damage done by weapon strikes.  Even plain
          cloth can help to prevent a blade from cutting.  Higher
          levels of armour protection cost significant amounts of
          money and the extra weight carried increases Encumbrance.
          The nature of this trade-off between armour types tends to
          reflect economic and technological realities, although
          cultural preferences are also a determinant.  Some cultures
          favor heavy armour, others prefer light armour, and a few
          consider wearing any armour to be cowardly.  Climate is also
          a consideration; wearing heavy, padded armours in a tropical
          climate is simply too exhausting to be practical.  Different
          types of armour are usually worn in overlapping layers, such
          as Surcoat (cloth) over Mail over Quilt.  The protective
          values of each layer are added together to determine total
          protection.  Moreover, some body parts may benefit from two
          layers of the same material.  For example, a warrior wearing
          a Mail hauberk and leggings, has double mail coverage for
          the Thigh, Groin, and Abdomen.
        </p>
        <p>
          Combatants must find a balance between the protection
          offered by armour and the Encumbrance penalty it brings.
          Mail, Scale, and Plate armours are heavy.  It may be
          tempting to wear multiple layers of Cloth or Quilt, but this
          is highly encumbering and especially fatiguing on a hot day.
          Each extra layer of Cloth or Quilt (except where they
          naturally occur from overlapping garments) incurrs a Special
          Penalty.

          The table assumes average quality materials.  Armour
          materials can be purchased at higher or lower qualities.
          The effect of these ratings (maximum +4) is to increase or
          decrease all protective values by the quality rating.  That
          is, a +1 mail Hauberk has protective values of B3, E9, P6,
          and F2.  No armour aspect can be reduced below one (1).
          Some Jmorvi Shek-Pvar with weaponcraft skill can produce
          enchanted armour.  Such pieces are rare and have +1 quality
          per level of enchantment.  To determine the quality for
          breakage, add all 4 protective values together through
          Row-5-Addition.

        <div class="explain">
          <p>
            <em>Cloth:</em> heavy, coarse cloth, typically buckram or
            serge, worn over or under other types of armour, or alone
            as everyday garb.  Fine linen clothing offers negligible
            armour protection.
          </p>
          <p>
            <em>Leather:</em> soft leather or animal hide.  Worn by
            itself, or as a base for Ring/Scale armours.
          </p>
          <p>
            <em>Quilt:</em> two layers of cloth, stuffed with wool or
            straw, then stitched together.  It is equivalent to Fur
            which some animals have as natural armour.
          </p>
          <p>
            <em>Kurbul:</em> Azeryani name for thick leather hardened
            by boiling in wax or oil to produce a lightweight,
            resilient leather-plate for spot protection.
          </p>
          <p>
            <em>Ring:</em> leather, reinforced by intermittent metal
            rings, strips, or studs.
          </p>
          <p>
            <em>Mail:</em> butted, coiled, or riveted metal rings,
            linked together.  Mail is lighter and more flexible than
            other metal armours, but is almost useless against Blunt
            and Fire strikes.  Quilt is usually worn under Mail.
          </p>
          <p>
            <em>Scale:</em> leather, reinforced by a continuous layer
            of thin, overlapping metal plates.

          <p>
            <em>Plate:</em> rigid, continuous, steel covering.
            Articulated, full-plate armour does not exist.  Plate is
            expensive and is used mainly for helms and spot
            protection.

          Strike location is important for two main reasons.  First,
          only the armour worn at the location struck is relevant.
          Second, injury effects vary by location; a blow to the skull
          is more serious than a blow to the foot.  The percentages
          allocated to body parts do not reflect the relative size of
          that part, since the head, arms, or groin are favored
          targets.  Combatants can influence Strike Location by
          targeting their aim.  Although combatants instinctively turn
          to face the most imminent threat, some armour only covers
          part of a strike location - a breastplate, for example, only
          covers the front of the thorax and abdomen.  In random
          situation, where it is hard to determine whether the front
          or back of a strike location is struck, experience shows
          there is a 75% chance of being struck on the front side.  An
          asterisk (*) indicates that Stumble or Fumbles may apply.

        <h3 id="actions">Actions</h3>
        <p>
          Actions will take their time as desired and will be resolved
          accordingly.  There is also no initiative, simply aborted
          actions, incomplete actions and action being affected by
          other activity.  Some of the more common actions are listed.
        </p>
        <div class="explain">
          <p>
            <em>Rest:</em> The combatant does nothing except possibly
            sit or lie down.  Resting combatants can attend to wounds,
            do minor weapon repairs, etc., and may defend normally if
            attacked later in a future second (and aware of the
            attack).  Any resting action is then aborted.
          </p>
          <p>
            <em>Move:</em> Unless physically hindered by obstacles or
            otherwise restrained, this option can take an arbitrary
            amount of time.  The maximum speed is given by Agility.
            If the combatant enters an enemy Engagement Zone, he may
            be attacked.  In the course of a Move, combatants may
            (within reason) change weapons, pick things up, etc.  This
            will be deducted from their speed or time spent moving.
          </p>
          <p>
            <em>Engage:</em> Combat involves footwork.  Once a
            combatant lays “claim” to a certain spot, it is assumed
            that he moves about that point, without losing essential
            contact to adjacent combatants.  This is called engagement
            and all engaged combatants are assumed to be able to move
            about as driven by necessity.  If for some reason this
            engagement cannot be upheld, penalties apply, either to
            attack or defense.  Disengage is a voluntary move out of
            the engagement zone of another combatant. This other
            combatant may choose to follow the disengaging combatant
            and thereby keeping him in the engagement zone. This
            voluntary footwork footwork has no penalties.
          </p>
          <p>
            <em>Charge:</em> At the end of a fast move an attack
            usually gains a bonus.  With steed, a Canter or Gallop
            move is needed.  Note the stopping impacts; Stumbles and
            Unhorsing may apply.  Also consider any collateral damage
            in the path of the charge.  These may bring the speed
            down.  At the end of the charge the steed may still be
            moving.  Otherwise, the steed halts, which could leave the
            rider and steed in the middle of a somewhat hostile crowd.
            To continue charging, the weapon must be readied again,
            which can be handled as a grope action.  Cavalrymen do not
            risk their extremely valuable horses galloping over
            battlefields, which are usually well supplied with
            furrows, rabbit holes, man-made pits, and caltrops.
            Galloping normally occurs only on good roads.  A cavalry
            “charge” is mostly trotting into position, with perhaps
            twenty to sixty yards of canter at the end.  Horses are
            extremely reluctant to charge into each other.  Unless
            both steeds are separated by a short wall, they will veer
            apart beyond the range of most melee weapons.  Charges
            against mounted opponents are rare except in organized
            tournaments.
          </p>
          <p>
            <em>Push:</em> A combatant may intend to push another back
            without grappling him or charging into him.  When this is
            intended during an attack.  Opposed Push moves may cancel
            out.  (This is different from ramming, which is resolved
            as a collision, see mounted combat, which may also be
            applied to humans, particularly those that intend to use
            their weight “benefit”.)  Consider walls and ledges.
            Moving over a ledge may not be preventable, but moving
            into a wall generally is.
          </p>
          <p>
            <em>Rise:</em> When a combatant stumbles (falls prone) he
            may try to get up; Acrobatics/Tumbling skills apply.  The
            action is always successful unless the combatant is
            forcibly held down, suffering from a serious or grievous
            wound, etc.
          </p>
          <p>
            <em>Grope:</em> Any action taken in Combat which requires
            manual dexterity, but is not an attack.  For example, an
            attempt to draw or change weapons, string a bow, or
            retrieve an item from the ground are Grope actions.  A
            Grope is automatically successful unless the combatant is
            forcibly held down, suffering from a serious or grievous
            wound, currently engaged, etc.  Legerdemain applies.
            During a Grope, the combatant is considered prone.
          </p>
          <p>
            <em>Melee Attack:</em> An effort to strike one engaged
            enemy with a melee weapon.  Engaged combatants can move
            about as stated in Engagement.  Melee Attacks generally
            take time, looking for an opening, sequencing weapon
            clashes, etc., before the weapon eventually strikes.
            Melee Attacks with bows or generally with a missile weapon
            is possible. A Shortbow, Hartbow, or Blowgun is treated as
            a stick, a Longbow as a staff, a Crossbow as a club, etc.
          </p>
          <p>
            <em>Missile Attack:</em> Unprepared missile weapons
            (unstrung, packed, etc.) must be prepared by means of a
            Grope (above) and cannot be used until then.  Assuming a
            prepared missile or throwing weapon is available, a
            combatant has one of two options: [1] Fire, which takes
            two seconds for any weapon, or [2] Load, which takes two
            (2) seconds for arrows and sling stones, but 10 seconds
            for a crossbow.  A Rider Attack may also occur during a
            Mounted Move.  Rider attacks are resolved normally.  A
            lance may attack anything within 5 feet, but a 3-foot long
            sword or mace held in the right hand has restrictions.
            Discretionary Aiming Zone modifiers for the rider and
            warrior afoot may apply.
          </p>
          <p>
            <em>Grapple Attack:</em> Any attempt to grapple, hold, or
            wrestle with one engaged opponent using Unarmed Combat.
            The Attacker must move into the location of the opponent,
            which is without penalty. The attacker attempts to impair
            the usage of limbs (or weapons) without causing fatigue or
            injury.  If the grappler achieves any “Strike” result, a
            hold on the opponent has been gained.  Determine Strike
            Location normally.  The entire zone (Head, Body, Arms, or
            Legs) is considered tangled, but with arms and legs, left
            and right should be distinguished.  The attacker's a
            weapon (e.g. his arm/hand) becomes entangled to maintain a
            hold/entanglement on the opponent.  The attacker can
            release his hold any time (if the weapon was a net, a
            successful grope action is applicable).  The wound level
            implied by the weapon is treated as penalty to any fumble
            or stumble rolls.  Tangle/Grapple penalties apply until
            cleared by a successful Grope for weapons or grapple for
            maintained holds; tangled weapons may be dropped to escape
            the effect of the tangle.
          </p>
          <p>
            <em>Grapple Defense:</em> An attempt to escape the hold of
            an attacker.  The defender tests his unarmed combat to
            reduces his hold penalties accordingly.  Of course, the
            defender may instead attempt to grapple the attacker
            himself.
          </p>
          <p>
            <em>Esoteric Attack/Defense:</em> This option is available
            to combatants capable of using magic, or psionics, or able
            to call for divine intervention.  an esoteric option may
            not be available to engaged combatants.  an esoteric
            option that fails may have misfire results that affect
            both defender and attacker.
          </p>
          <p>
            <em>Dropping Items:</em> Items may normally be freely
            discarded without resorting to a Grope.  However, dropping
            an item which is tied on requires a Grope action.
          </p>
          <p>
            <em>Tangle Attacks:</em> Certain weapons have the ability
            to tangle an opponent or the opponent’s weapons.  Some
            weapons, such as the net, are designed specifically for
            this purpose.  Tangle attacks may be attempted with
            cloaks, blankets, nets, flails, whips, ropes, or other
            items.  If the tangle (or any other attack!) is aimed at a
            weapon, one Main location is replaced with the weapon,
            usually the leg of the “other” side.  A tangle attack is
            treated as a melee attack (or missile attack if the tangle
            weapon is thrown).
          </p>
          <p>
            <em>Block/Dodge:</em> An attempt to block, parry, or dodge
            the attack with a declared weapon (if available), usually
            a shield, although any held weapon, including a hand/arm,
            may be used.  The defender must be aware of the attack.
          </p>
          <p>
            <em>Ignore:</em> This option is normally taken only by
            combatants who are unaware of the attack (or objects).
            This may result from extreme surprise or from the Defender
            being physically incapable of defense.
          </p>
          <p>
            <em>Mount/Dismount:</em> Mount or dismount in combat.
            Consider this a climb of five (5) feet but use Riding
            skill to determine speed.  (Obviously, a grappling hook
            does not grant a bonus, but stirrup do.)
          </p>
          <p>
            <em>Mounted Move:</em> A Mounted Move is made on part of
            the horse, the rider may act separately. Be aware that
            horses as large quadrupeds are more easily cornered or
            hindered in movement than medium bipeds such as humans.
          </p>
          <p>
            <em>Steed Trample:</em> An attack by the Steed, commanded
            by the Rider.  The defender may be located in a 5 foot
            radius around the steed - horses can wheel and kick in any
            direction (especially backwards) with great force.  Steed
            Trample may be quite useful, if the rider is injured, or
            has dropped a weapon.  A steed trample is like a Melee
            Attack.
          </p>
          <p>
            <em>Polearm Defense:</em> Steeds have great difficulty
            committing suicide.  Faced with a wall of sharp spears or
            stakes they generally balk and refuse to proceed.  This
            survival instinct can only be overcome at great risk to
            the rider.  The rider must make a special Steed Command
            Check with a &#9733;.&#9733;. penalty.  If the steed
            command fails, the steed makes an emergency stop, bucks,
            then flees.
          </p>
        </div>
        <h3 id="circumstances">Circumstances</h3>
        <p>
          <em>Weather:</em> Wind, rain/snow, mist/fog all have an
          effect on missile accuracy, especially at longer ranges.
          Wet bowstrings lose their tautness and are easily ruined if
          the bow is strung.  When rain strikes, professional archers
          commonly unstring their bow and keep the bow string dry by
          storing it under their helmet.  But if an archer does not
          mind risking a bowstring, a bow can be fired during a
          rainstorm.  Bowstrings have a WQ of 8.  There is also a
          Weather penalty on the archer to reflect reduced visibility
          in rain.  Very cold (wooden) bows often shatter when drawn.
          If the air temperature is freezing, archers who attempt to
          fire their bow sometimes see that their bow breaks when
          drawn.
        </p>
        <p>
          <em>Ammunition:</em> Combatants equipped with a Javelin or
          Shorkana may carry two or three (each is listed as a
          separate weapon).  Most archers carry 12–24 arrows/quarrels,
          an extra bow, and three bowstrings for each bow.  Assuming
          there is a plentiful supply of stones, ammo for Slings and
          Staff Slings can be ignored.
        </p>
        <p>
          <em>Close Mode:</em> Some weapons, especially swung weapons,
          are difficult to use in restricted space.  A Battlesword,
          for example, is superior to a Shortsword when fighting
          outdoors; but, in a narrow passageway or crowded melee, may
          be at a disadvantage.  Generally, any thrusting weapon (such
          as a Spear, or a Sword employing Point aspect) has no
          disadvantages.  Close Mode never penalizes Shields.
        </p>
        <p>
          <em>Target Shooting:</em> Archery contests are popular at
          all fairs.  In such contests, the target is generally set up
          at 100 yards range.  It has a bull worth five points, then
          three concentric rings valued at three, two, and one point.
          The size is 3 feet.  The intended wound level is &#9733;.
          Hitting the target is 0, hitting the inner ring is &#9733;
          and hitting the bull is &#9733;&#9733;.
        </p>
        <p>
          <em>Warhorses:</em> The relationship between a warhorse and
          its rider is profound, almost telepathic in its depth of
          communication.  It takes years to forge and is not lightly
          undertaken.  A knight found weeping on the battlefield is as
          likely grieving over a fallen horse as a dead comrade.  The
          best warhorses require extensive bonding and patient
          training.  Horses are not seriously ridden until they are
          two years old, and very few are combat trained before age
          three.  Although horses do not have the capacity for
          language, they can be trained to respond to verbal commands.
          Several cultures breed ponies for war, notably the Chelni
          and Hodiri tribal nations of Hârn.

          <em>Steeds:</em> Steed quality is largely measured by Steed
          Morale, although other attributes such as Strength and Move
          are also important considerations when judging a horse.  The
          principal effect of combat training is to increase Steed
          Morale, but Trample Mastery can also be improved.  Steed
          combat training is undertaken by the rider.  The rider must
          invest in the development of his horse as in his own.  Steed
          Morale is reduced by &#9733;&#9733;, when a steed has a
          different rider/trainer.  This becomes a permanent reduction
          if the new rider is the new owner.  The loss can recovered
          through training with the new owner.
        </p>
        <p>
          <em>Barding:</em> Horse armour is rare on Hârn, partly due
          to high cost, partly because the protection gained does not
          justify the encumbrance.  A Thorax strike has a chance of
          striking the saddle and/or saddle blanket.  The occasional
          chanfron (Plate covering the horse’s Skull and Face (except
          eyes &#0038; muzzle) weight 20 lb, cost 500d+) is seen on
          the steeds of rich knights.  Some very rich knights defy
          convention and armour their horses as a status symbol, but
          rarely fight that way.
        </p>
        <p>
          <em>Afoot versus Mounted:</em> A combatant afoot may attack
          the rider or the steed normally.  Aiming Zones may be
          limited.  The rider may defend normally.  The same is true
          in reverse and depends on the length of the weapon in both
          cases.  Warhorses are valuable booty and can usually be
          ransomed or sold.  Many knights consider it immoral to
          attack horses, although footmen about to be trampled are
          less reluctant.
        </p>
        <p>
          <em>Riderless Horses:</em> When a horse finds itself without
          a rider, it will either stand in place or wander off.  Test
          Steed Morale: On success, the steed stays with its rider, on
          failure, it wanders off.  The rate of departure for a
          fleeing steed is generally a canter.
        </p>
        <h3 id="morale">Morale</h3>
        <p>
          A battle is a noisy, confusing, scary place.  The clash of
          arms, shouting, screaming (often some whimpering and dull
          thudding) can make it difficult to hear commands and cries
          for help.  For this reason combatants do not always do what
          their superiors want them to do.  Battle experience,
          discipline, and morale are three ambiguous, but important,
          elements in any battle.  All these factors are accounted for
          by Morale, which benefits individuals with high Morale and
          is detrimental to combatants with low Morale.  Having been
          prone in a Combat situation applies a penalty of &#9733;&#9733; to Horse
          Morale, which fades away.
        </p>
        <p>
          <em>Normal:</em> A combatant with normal morale behaves
          without constraint, selecting and executing any reasonable
          action option.
        </p>
        <p>
          <em>Cautious:</em> A cautious combatant will not Engage,
          must choose Pass if engaged, and will not Counterstrike.
        </p>
        <p>
          <em>Desperate:</em> Combatant tries to conclude the battle,
          one way or the other, as soon as possible.  Until the
          situation changes and a new Morale Test is passed, the
          combatant selects the most aggressive option available.
        </p>
        <p>
          <em>Broken:</em> The individual is unable to fight in any
          useful way.  The only available options are flight or
          surrender.  Flight is normally preferable; surrender is a
          last resort.  If neither is feasible, the individual makes a
          Rest or Pass action option, but can defend if attacked
          except that Counterstrike is prohibited.
        </p>
        <p>
          <em>Rally:</em> The individual has enough combatant to
          support others in their Morale.  He may provide his success
          to Morale rolls of others he can communicate with.  This is
          valid for a synchronous Morale roll only.  This may be
          augmented by Rhetoric.
        </p>
        <p>
          <em>Berserk:</em> This is a special state of battle-frenzy.
          Any combatant who enters this mode will take the most
          aggressive action available for Attack or Defense, adding &#9733;
          to Attack Mastery subtracting &#9733; from Mastery to defend.
          Further Morale rolls are ignored until the battle ends.
          Some combatants may have a cultural heritage of berserking,
          or a particular reason to go berserk.
        </p>
        <h3 id="wounds">Wounds</h3>
        <p>
          Combatants who sustain Serious or Grievous wounds may die
          during the healing routine.  On the other hand, various
          types of magic, miracles, Psionics, and potions can improve
          healing.  The following wound types exist and individual
          wounds are tracked with their location.  Effects on the use
          of the corresponding part are described below.
        </p>
        <p>
          <em>&#9733;:</em> Minor.  Wounds only have wound
          penalty.
        </p>
        <p>
          <em>&#9733;&#9733;:</em> Serious. Wounds of this type also
          have minor effects on neighbouring detailed body parts at
          &#9733; less.  Any activity involving these body parts are
          at the appropriate penalty.  These “effect” wounds do not
          heal separately.
        </p>
        <p>
          <em>&#9733;&#9733;&#9733;:</em> Grievous.  The detailed body part
          cannot be used, serious use effects on neighbouring detailed
          body parts, and minor on main parts.  These “effect” wounds
          do not heal separately.  Minor effects are at &#9733;&#9733;
          less than the Grievous, while serious are &#9733; less.
        </p>
        <p>
          <em>&#9733;&#9733;&#9733;&#9733;:</em> Incapacitating, the
          main body part cannot be used, serious use effects on
          neighbouring main body parts.  (For head this means
          unconsciousness and for thorax imminent death.)  Serious
          effects are at &#9733;&#9733; less than the Incapacitating.
        </p>
        <p>
          <em>&#9733;&#9733;&#9733;&#9733;&#9733;:</em> Destroyed, the main body part lost
          its integrity, Grievous use effects on neighbouring main
          body parts.  (For limbs this means at least severed.  Thorax
          is split open or spinal cord severed.  For all but the
          extremities this means instant death.  For all other body
          parts, death is probably imminent due to the side effects.)
          Grievous use effects are at &#9733;&#9733; less than the
          Destroyed.
        </p>
        <p>
          <em>Fumble/Stumble:</em> A wound level &#9733; above
          Dexterity on an arm causes any object held to be dropped, a
          Fumble.  A wound level &#9733; above Agility on a leg
          causes the victim to fall down, a Stumble.  A combatant with
          wound level of less than &#9733;&#9733; above Dexterity is
          eligible for a Grope action to pick up any object dropped.
          A combatant that dropped to a Stumble but with a wound less
          than &#9733;&#9733; above Agility is likewise able to get
          back up.  If the wound level exceeds these &#9733;&#9733; the pain and
          structural damage preclude recovery.
        </p>
        <p>
          Any wound needs to heal its injury points.  This depends on
          Stamina; medicine may improve the healing rate.  A physician
          may attempt to find or create the correct medicine but his
          skill does not add to the healing directly.  A serious wound
          may become infected until it turns into a minor wound.  An
          infection is a daily attack on the wounded area with a level
          of the wound, defended against with Stamina.  Medicine
          applies in the same way as for minor wounds, but it harder
          to obtain.  A penalty of &#9733; is suitable.  Any
          injury points gained through the infection is added to the
          original wound.  This may turn the wound into a grievous
          wound.  A grievous wound is a bleeder or otherwise makes the
          body lose vital fluids.  Bloodloss is treated as a separate
          injury.  Note that the circulatory system is incapacitated
          with points in excess of &#9733;&#9733;&#9733; as other body
          parts are.  The circulatory system itself will not turn
          infectious.  Treatment by physicians depend on the location.
          Some locations are incurable by Hârnic physicians.  For
          multiple bleeders only take the maximum in the same
          extremity, but add those for different extremities.
          Incapacitating and destroying wounds have no additional
          effects over the bleeder and infection dangers.
        </p>
        <p>
          The healing routine assumes a combatant will mainly be
          resting during the healing process.  If a combatant gets
          involved in unreasonable physical exertion during Healing,
          the days of rest accumulated since the last day are forfeit;
          wounds are often aggravated or reopened by premature
          activity.  Injury and Encumbrance penalties are ignored
          during Healing.  Fatigue penalty (if any) are applied –
          injured combatants are supposed to get lots of rest.
        </p>
        <p>
          The standard treatments mostly known by all still need to be
          applied and detailed, so a physician's diagnosis is always
          necessary.  “Destroyed” wounds may be treated as
          incapacitating, with a Bonus on Diagnosis of &#9733;.
          Note that the usage effects on bordering regions needs to be
          treated as well.

          Fire and internal system damage is treated as frost, but
          some treatments may not be applied, because they will kill
          the patient.  I.e. cleaning and dressing an internal organ
          is not possible for Hârnic medicine.  A secondary treatment
          to sterilize and seal a Minor or Serious wound is
          Cauterization.  It cannot be used on Grievous or worse
          wounds.  The procedure is done after a wound’s treatment has
          been established by the normal treatment rules.  A metallic
          object and fire are required.  Cauterization is attempted at
          Physician Mastery add &#9733;.  The effect is to close
          the wound and modify the Healing Rate a second time.
          Cauterization cannot be undone or re-attempted.  It always
          leaves a nasty, broad scare and Comeliness effects may be
          applicable.  Amputations and immediate cauterizations stop
          infections.

          Diseases and Toxins come in various forms.  All of the below
          characteristics are subject to improvements by a
          knowledgeable physician.  Some poisons and ailments may be
          subject to infections.  <em>Deterioration:</em> This is the
          speed at which wound points are accrued.  This can be
          modified by Stamina.  <em>Maximum Injury:</em> The maximum
          amount of injury the wound will cause, after deterioration
          has set in.  Note that healing may prevent the maximum to
          actually be reached.  <em>Heal time:</em> This is the speed at
          which wound points are reduced.  Assume this to set in at
          the same time deterioration sets in.

        <h3 id="Jousting">Jousting</h3>
        <p>
          Jousting is a formalized style of combat between two mounted
          contestants, whose object is to charge and strike the
          opponent with a couched lance.  It is seen at most Hârnic
          tournaments.  The rules for winning vary, but the most
          common set is known as the Laranian Joust.  This contest is
          won by the first jouster to accumulate three (3) points.
          Breaking a jousting pole against an opponent counts as one
          (1) point and unhorsing an opponent counts as three (3)
          points.  Striking any part of the saddle scores no points
          and striking a steed (causing injury) is automatic
          disqualification.  The jousters are permitted to make no
          more than three passes in a bout.  If, after three tilts,
          the score remains tied, or if both knights are
          simultaneously unhorsed, the combatants fight on foot using
          (real) swords or maces.  The first knight to strike his
          opponent three times is the winner, except strikes to the
          shield do not count.
        </p>
        <p>
          Jousts require the use of jousting poles, which are a
          specialty of polearm.  These are listed on the Weapon Data
          Table.  Compared to a regular Lance, Jousting Poles are much
          longer (typically 15feet), more fragile (they are intended
          to break on impact), and the tip is padded or fitted with a
          coronel to prevent the weapon from piercing armour.  The
          price (40d) assumes the jousting pole is painted and fitted
          with a coronel and vamplate.  A plain wooden jousting pole
          costs only 24d.  At Laranian tournaments jousting poles are
          fitted with a flared metal vamplate to protect (B6 E10 P6
          F2) the right hand.
        </p>
        <p>
          Jousters wear the same armour in the Joust as they would in
          war – only more if possible.  While there is nothing in the
          way of specialized armour for the Joust, most participants
          wear great helms and additional protection to the torso,
          such as a Kurbul breastplate.  At most tournaments, jousters
          are required to wear a linen Surcoat showing their heraldic
          device.  Some jousters, particularly the wealthy ones,
          attempt to stand out by wearing (sometimes outlandish)
          crests on their helms and Ailettes on their shoulders
          displaying their heraldry.  Knights may also cover their
          steeds with a caparison that displays heraldic colors and
          device.  Caparisons typically weigh about 30lb and cost at
          least 240d, often a lot more depending on materials and
          design.
        </p>
        <p>
          Jousting is used to settle affairs of honor among nobles
          (dueling).  If both participants and the organizer agree,
          more lethal, regular lances may be used.  It is accepted
          that those too old or infirm to joust, or those of high
          station, may appoint a champion to joust for them, even in
          duels of honor.  The privilege of a lady’s favor may be
          granted to a noble knight.  The value of such a token is
          purely symbolic, a romantic epitome of the chivalric ethos.
          The nature of the favor can have complex symbolism of its
          own.  A scarf or kerchief is a neutral item, a garter or
          lock of hair may not be.  Some favors are displayed
          publicly; some are not.
        </p>
        <p>
          Jousting is simultaneous combat.  The two combatants spur
          their horses to charge, and then attack each other as they
          pass.  Riding skill has an effect on the jouster’s combat.
          Each jouster makes a Steed Command check to begin the
          charge.
