        <p>
          This is a set of rules, which represent the aspects dealt
          with in the HM3 rule book. Since our aim is to simplify,
          we will not rewrite all rules, only those that are needed.
          See <a href="main.xml">Main Rule</a> for the generic details.
        </p>
        <p>
          Sometimes people ask, why rewrite the rules, if the way that
          they adjucate situations changes only slightly and this only
          adds another layer of complexity.  In fact, we add a layer
          of simplification.  The benefit of better scaling and other
          issues that are better addressed warrant the effort.

        <h3 id="s3kills">Overview</h3>
        <p>
          Whenever we have ML, SB or other technical terms, we append
          an U to distinguish the Universal rules, from the
          classic. E.g. MLU and SBU.  You can calculate MLU as ML *
          0.4.  The basic 50/50 chance of success on a skill roll is
          with an ML of 50%, i.e. an MLU of 20. Thus the most basic
          task difficulty - all other things being equal - should be
          set to 20.
        </p>
        <p>
          Attributes are treated as Skills with MLU twice their value.
          It is useful to track them accordingly.
        </p>
        <h4>Skill Development</h4>
        <p>
          Skill Development is applicable only to PCs and a
          narrative rule.  Every game session, award 2 points (SP)
          that can each be used to increase any skill MLU in the
          range 0-9 by 1 point, in the range 10-19 by 1/2 points,
          in the range 20-29 by 1/4 points and so forth.
          Teachers are also handled narratively.  This narrative 
          rule can be changed or adapted at any time, it is not
          bound to in.world simulation.
        </p>
        <p>
          In-world MLU improvement happens with the same range costs
          as above, but 1 SP is gained every month after completing
          NPC/PC creation.
        </p>
        <p>
          Improving Specialties is more elaborate.  Skills list
          specialties with a percentage value.  This percentage value
          gives the part of the whole group that this specialization
          comprises.  When the skill is improved (the skill group of
          all specialties) all improvement may be dedicated to the
          specialty instead.
        </p>
        <p>
          As an example, a <em>Skill/ASpecialty/20</em> could see an
          improvement of 5 points if <em>ASpecialty</em> instead of a
          1 for <em>Skill</em>.  A <em>Skill/BSpecialty/40</em> could
          see an improvement of 2.5 points if <em>BSpecialty</em>
          instead of a 1 for <em>Skill</em>.  Divide 100% by the given
          percentage to get a multiple <em>m</em>.
        </p>
        <p>
          If at any time the skill itself is developed, specialties
          are only improved, if they would fall below the MLU of the
          skill otherwise.  It would be prudent to learn the
          &#8220;opposite&#8221; Specialty.
        </p>
        <h4>Star Scale</h4>
        <p>
          The star-scale is often used to simplify evaluation.
        </p>
        <table class="links" style="width:75%">
          <tr>
            <th>Stars</th>
            <td>&#9733;</td>
            <td>&#9733;&#9733;</td>

            <th>MLU</th>
            <td>5-15</td>
            <td>15-25</td>
            <td>25-35</td>
            <td>35-45</td>
            <td>45-55</td>
          </tr>
        </table>
        <h4>Specialties</h4>
        <p>
          Many skills can be divided into sub-skills or specialties.
          The specific specialty takes the initial MLU from the main
          skill&#8217;s MLU.  Each specialty is developed as a separate
          skill.
        </p>
        <p>
          Sometimes, only Specialties are given and the question
          arises, what MLU in the Specialty applies to the skill
          group.  Apply the specialty rule in reverse.  Take the
          percentage of Specialty MLU to get the skill&#8217;s MLU.
          For example, a Mask/20 specialty in Woodcraft of 12 would
          imply a Woodcraft MLU of 2.4.  This applies only to MLU.
        </p>
        <h4>Sunsign</h4>
        <p>
          Sunsigns represent an astrological affinity to certain
          skills in-world, see original rules.  They give a direct
          bonus to the MLU.
        </p>
        <h4>Skill Testing</h4>
        <p>
          When a character attempts to use a skill, n5 is rolled,
          adding EMLU.  The GM will have decided upon a diffculty
          level of the task.  This value is also subtracted from the
          roll and if the net result is non-negative, the skill has
          been successfully employed; if the roll is negative, the
          attempt has failed.  For example, if a PC declares the
          intent to perform a gymnastic feat, the GM would instruct
          the player to &#8220;test Acrobatics against difficulty
          15.&#8221; In cases where success or failure may not be
          obvious, the GM should make the roll secretly.
        </p>
        <p>
          To determine the degree of success or failure, use the
          dimensions.
        </p>
        <p>
          When two characters use skills against each other, each
          character makes a p5 skill roll appropriate to the skill in
          question and the results are compared to give a net result.
          The character with the higher result wins the challenge.  If
          both characters achieve the same success level, this is a
          stalemate.  If a tie is not appropriate to the situation,
          toss a coin.
        </p>
        <h3 id="d3im">Dimensions</h3>
        <p>
          The following shows example dimensions.  Finding the
          appropriate dimension depends on the concrete circumstances.
          Consider what would be appropriate for an untrained
          individual (MLU 0) and what is expected (the average result)
          for a sufficiently educated persion (MLU 20).  Interprete
          the results inbetween and outside of the bounds accordingly.

        <p>
          Assume a standard task level of 20 and adjust the result for
          any applicable modifiers (such as Hardiness Rating, also
          multiplied by 0.4), the resulting net value gives double the
          percentage of the crop yield that is in excess or short of
          the 100%.  (See H&#226;rn Manor 29.)  For example, if the
          MLU is 20, (task level is 20) all modifiers are a total of
          -10 and the roll itself is +5, then the net value is -5,
          resulting in a crop yield of 97.5% in the given year.
        </p>
        <h5 class="skill" id="di-cli">Climbing</h5>
        <p>
          Climbing Speed is 1/4 walking speed at success. Speed can be
          modified 1/4 for a -10 penalty for a trajectory, but
          negative speeds are not allowed.  E.g. for a +10, one can
          opt to simply try and cling to a holding to not fall down.
          A failure results in a fall, usually evenly distributed
          among the total climb.
        </p>
        <h5 class="skill" id="di-co1">Combat</h5>
        <p>
          One dimension is the time (in seconds), which it takes to
          achieve the wound level zero on the defender.  The wound
          level is a separate dimension.  You should use trajectories.
          Once a (rolled) progression has reached its goal, a new
          skill roll is necessary.  It is therefore possible to play
          10 second round-based combat.
        </p>
        <p>
          The fractional parts for the higher values in the time
          dimension mean that multiple attacks &#8220;connect&#8221;
          at the same time.  This is to avoid combat in split seconds.
        </p>
        <p>
          Any effects from wounds or other external influences in
          combat are applied immediately to pending progressions, but
          the wound itself is modified by <em>B/E/P</em> of choice
          from the weapon and the appropriate armor.  (These valueas
          are multiplied by 0.4!)  The offset is along the trajectory
          chosen.  Note that the same is true for affects on the
          defender.  If this implies an action to occur in the past,
          it is resolved immediately.

        <p>
          Initiative reflects battle experience, discipline, and
          morale.  Initiative determines the speed in which characters
          can assess a stressful situation.  Characters take the time
          listed before they can act.  An ambush and similar
          situations can give a bonus.
        </p>
        <p>
          During the time a character is &#8220;frozen&#8221; this
          way, he is trying to understand the situation he is in and
          assesses the options he has.  He is <em>cautious</em> during
          that time.  General awareness issues such as during an
          ambush are not covered by Initiative.
        </p>
        <p>
          Battle-hardened characters may come into the fractional
          range often.  Optionally fractions can be used to determine
          who goes first.  The GM determines, whether going first
          impedes the action of another already in the second that
          action culminates.  This changes the drama of simultaneous
          activity, which may or may not be appropriate.

          At the beginning of each combat the players and GM should
          jointly decide which action options they want to allow and
          which will simply be abstracted by a set penalty/bonus by
          the GM.  This can speed up combat tremendously.  If tactical
          options outside of combat are affected by the decision, the
          GM should inform the players of that.  For instance, if
          mounted combat is to tedious today, than the PCs might just
          as well dismount already to allow for smoother combat
          resolution.
        </p>
        <p>
          In order to simulate larger combats with many participants,
          the usual 5-Addition can be used.  It does not provide as
          many tactical options as individual combat does, but greatly
          reduces time spent.  Both time and wound dimension should be
          scaled linearly with the number of particpipants.  E.g. a
          wound of 5 after 30 seconds would scale to a total of 50
          points after 5 minutes for 10 people or to 500 points after
          50 minutes for 100 people.  The points should be distributed
          in reasonable batches on the participants on each side, the
          smallest batch size being the wounds rolled.  People can be
          hit multiple times, but points beyond 40 generally
          don&#8217;t make sense unless explosives, catapults, or
          similar are involved.

          Fatigue recovers 1/10 seconds.  With spirit dissolution,
          fatigue turns into injury.  Note that spirits can take
          arbitrary injury before being destroyed and may heal
          forever.  Only in rare cases (e.g. divine intervention) can
          spirits be destroyed.

          Subtract 2 from Missile MLU for being mounted.  To avoid

        </p>
        <h5 id="co-engage">Engage</h5>
        <p>
          Every character has an <em>Engagement Zone</em> of 1m plus
          weapon length radius about his center (that does not extend
          into blocked areas).  The Engagement Zone of a conscious,
          prone character is only half that.  Unconscious characters
          have no Engagement Zones but may constitute obstacles.  A
          character may be (melee) attacked upon entering an
          enemy&#8217;s Engagement Zone until he leaves that zone.
          This entering or leaving may be active or passive.  It is
          possible to be engaged with an arbitrary number of enemies
          at a time.  A character with a long reach weapon has an
          appropriately larger engagement zone and may therefore be
          eligible to attack before others.  This may be of importance
          for mounted Charges into a row of Pikemen.  Also note the
          restriction on using long weapons at short range.
          dimensions.
        </p>
        <h5 id="co-charge">Charge</h5>
        <p>
          Every engagement along the way may attack a moving character
          (and vice versa).  Any attacker plunging into defenders with
          an attack will stop.  Such a forced stop will result in a
          fall impact for charger as if from height equal to the speed
          minus 5.  E.g. stopping at 10 m/s speed equals a fall from
          5m.  Note that the fall impact also applies the targets
          fallen into.  This is the charge bonus which can be added to
          the attack.  For opportunistic melee attacks, this is also a
          direct penalty to the Dodge skill.
        </p>
        <h5 id="co-push">Push</h5>
        <p>
          The push attempt must be in the direction the attacker is
          facing and the attacker must follow.  The defender has a
          choice to evade into a semi-circle of up to 120 degrees,
          assuming no obstacles.  Instead of Injury points, meters
          (pushed) are used.  The defender is forced to deduct the
          move from his action allowance, regardless of whether he
          resists or not.  A resist deducts from the distance forced
          and can even be used as a counter-push.  The pushed
          character may opt to fall prone instead at any time, for
          instance to avoid falling of a cliff.  Any remaing distance
          is forfeit.

        <p>
          A rider and horse may act in unison and add their combat
          skill per 5-Addition.  Both accrue the same fatigue.
          Hitting the wrong target can happen in melee combat.
          Anybody within an engagement zone is subject to an
          (unintentional) attack with MLU 0. This can be added to the
          benefit of other attackers as per multiple attacks above or
          resolved individually with the goal of 0 damage.  A
          character who is attacking (or being attacked by) a prone
          enemy increases Attack/Defense MLU with that character by 4.
        </p>
        <h5 id="co-missile">Missile Attack</h5>
        <p>
          For throwing arbitrary objects, use Throwing skill.  Since
          missile attacks are resolved with individual shots, a missed
          attack is applied only if the intended attack had no impact.
          Count all potential targets completely in an arc of 30
          degrees and +/-2 range levels of the intended target.  Use
          5-Addition of zeroes, but reduce by 5 for the missed,
          intended opponent.  If a hit is scored on the much larger
          &#8220;super-target&#8221;, roll which individual target is
          hit by distributing evenly among all the unintended targets.
          When determining hit chances and damage apply the size
          modifier from the Size table below.  At GM discretion,
          inanimate objects not participating in the skirmish may be
          counted as potential targets, particularly, if the actual
          targets are spread widely across the area.  This increase
          can be used purposefully and can be quite devastating when
          firing at advancing troops.  Dodge against missile is
          reduced by 5.
        </p>
        <h5 id="co-grapple">Grapple/Tangle Attack Defense</h5>
        <p>
          Use Unarmed Combat skill when no weapon is involved.
          Multiple Grapples are allowed , but keep track of the
          grappled weapons of all opponents, they can no longer be
          used to full potential.
        </p>
        <h5 id="co-block">Block/Dodge</h5>
        <p>
          For dodging, use Dodge skill.  Dodge and Block/Parry are
          added through 5-Addition, if used together.  Dodge/parry is
          mostly used at the same time an attack is contemplated by
          the defender himself.  Every defense causes a -5 penalty to
          all activity, which phases out within 10 seconds.  E.g., the
          first attacker is defended at full MLU, the second at MLU-5
          and the third is at MLU-10 and so on.  Note that multiple
          attacks can be 5-added instead.  In that case a second
          attack gets a bonus of 5, etc.  Also note that Dodge is at
          -5 for high velocity missile attacks.
        </p>
        <h5 id="co-aim">Aiming</h5>
        <p>
          The Attacker may declare one Main area as not being hit for
          a penalty of 1 to MLU.  This choice can be taken multiple
          times, but the remaining Main locations must remain (bodily)
          connected.  If all but one Main location has been
          eliminated, individual percentage points may be reduced for
          a Detail area.  This penalty can again be taken multiple
          times but the remaining Detail hit locations must be
          (bodily) connected.  The GM may restrict or penalize the
          choice of Aiming Zone if the attacker could only reach
          certain target zones with the declared attack weapon.  A
          prone attacker would find it difficult to aim high on a
          standing opponent with a melee weapon.  The Size table can
          be used, if the target is smaller than man-sized.  This
          effect does not cumulate with aiming for parts of a target
          (the main part of this paragraph).  There is no modification
          for man-sized creatures, unless the target offers a smaller
          effective target, but it may be combined with unintentional
          hitting (see above).  A prone man, for example, presents a
          target about 2 feet tall, and a crouching man about 4 feet
          tall.  Similar height adjustments may apply to other targets
          at GM discretion.
        </p>
        <h5 id="co-fumble">Fumble</h5>
        <p>
          Any new wound of at least 1 point to arms results in a
          Fumble chance.  Use accumulated damage to that extremity and
          fatigue as difficulty for a Dexterity skill roll against 0.
          Failure results in dropping anything held on that arm.  If
          something is held in both hands, 5-add the difficulties and
          the two Dexterity EMLUs.

        <h5 id="co-stumble">Stumble</h5>
        <p>
          Any new wound of at least 1 point to legs results in a

          and fatigue as difficulty for an Agility skill roll against
          0.  Failure results in dropping prone. Each additional leg

        <h5 id="co-shock">Shock</h5>
        <p>
          Any new wound of at least 1 point results in a Shock chance.
          Use accumulated injury and fatigue as difficulty for a
          Stamina skill roll against 0.  Failure results in
          unconsciousness for a time indiciated in the Shock table.
        </p>
        <h5 id="co-inanimate">Inanimate Damage</h5>
        <p>
          Instead of (autonomous) Healing, Repair must be applied
          externally.  Use the appropriate Craft skill instead of
          Physician.
        </p>
        <h5 id="co-weapdam">Weapon/Armor Damage</h5>
        <p>
          Weapon and Armor make a Shock roll for the damage that they
          absorb, respectively deal.  Weapon Quality (WQ) is used
          instead of Stamina skill and damage is not accumulated.
          Armor works the same way, but instead if Stamina, sum up
          BEPF.  Failure means a weapon or armor breaks, which may
          potentially be repaired as above. (Regular maintenance is
          assumed, otherwise accumlate 1 point per &#8220;unrepaired
          wound&#8221; for weapons and armor for the purpose of Shock
          rolls.
        </p>
        <h5 id="co-blooodloss">Bloodloss</h5>
        <p>
          Damage taken increases with every complete multiple of 5
          injury level above 6 every 10s.  For example, a 16-20 point
          injury causes 2 points per 10 seconds, or 1 point of
          bloodloss every 5 seconds.  Some wounds will not cause
          bloodloss (e.g. Frost) including to inanimate objects or
          reduced damage, e.g. blunt trauma.

        <p>
          Combatants who sustain Serious or Grievous wounds may die
          during the healing routine.  On the other hand, various
          types of magic, miracles, Psionics, and potions can improve
          healing.
        </p>
        <p>
          When the following text says, adjacent body parts are
          affected, effects include penalties (which are not
          cumulative but take the maximum) infection chance and
          bloodloss (also not cumulative but take the maximum).  They
          are not recursive, i.e. do not imply secondary effects.
        </p>
        <p>
          <em>1-5:</em> Minor.  Wounds only have wound penalty.
        </p>
        <p>
          <em>5-10:</em> Serious. Wounds of this type also have minor
          effects on neighbouring detailed body parts at 5 points
          less.  Any activity involving these body parts are at the
          appropriate penalty.  These effect wounds do not heal
          separately.
        </p>
        <p>
          <em>11-15:</em> Grievous.  The detailed body part cannot be
          used, serious use effects on neighbouring detailed body
          parts, and minor on neighboring main parts. (This might only
          be the including main part.)  These effect wounds do not
          heal separately.  Minor effects are at 10 less than the
          Grievous, while serious are 5 less.
        </p>
        <p>
          <em>16-20:</em> Incapacitating, the main body part cannot be
          used, serious use effects on neighbouring main body parts.
          (For head this means unconsciousness and for thorax imminent
          death.)  Serious effects are at 10 less than the
          incapacitating wound itself.
        </p>
        <p>
          <em>21+:</em> Destroyed, the main body part lost its
          integrity, Grievous use effects on neighbouring main body
          parts.  (For limbs this means at least severed.  Thorax is
          split open or spinal cord severed.  For all but the
          extremities this means instant death.  For all other body
          parts, death is probably imminent due to the side effects.)
          Grievous use effects are at 10 less than the Destroyed wound
          itself.
        </p>
        <h3 id="heal-wounds">Healing</h3>
        <p>
          See the Healing dimension. An untreated wound is considered
          as being treated by a Physician with the negative
          wound-level.  E.g. a wound with 6 injury points is treated
          as if diagnosed by Physician with MLU -6.  The standard
          treatments mostly known by all still need to be applied and
          detailed, so a physician&#8217;s diagnosis is always
          necessary.  &#8220;Destroyed&#8221; wounds may be treated as
          incapacitating, with a Bonus on Diagnosis of 5.  Note that
          the usage effects on bordering regions needs to be treated
          as well.  Overtreatment is possible but has no specific
          negative impact.
        </p>
        <p>
          Bloodloss is treated as a separate injury.  Note that the
          circulatory system is incapacitated with points in excess of
          15 points as other body parts are.  The circulatory system
          itself will not turn infectious.  Treatment by physicians
          depend on the location.  Some locations are incurable by
          H&#226;rnic physicians.  For multiple bleeders only take the
          maximum in the same extremity, but add those for different
          extremities.  Incapacitating and destroying wounds have no
          additional effects over the bleeder and infection dangers.
        </p>
        <p>
          Infections, diseases, toxins, and other come in various
          forms.  Bloodloss is already explained elsewhere, but
          repeated here for reference.
        </p>
        <div class="explain">
          <p>
            <em>Bloodloss</em> Once a wound in excess of 10 points is
            received, bloodloss is calculated.  (Some form of damage
            do not create bloodloss, e.g. diseases.)  This number is
            lost every 10 seconds until the treatment
            <em>Compress</em> is applied.  Thereafter these points
            heal at 1 per day.
          </p>
          <p>
            <em>Infection</em> An open wound with more than 5 injury
            points is attacked daily with MLU of the injury points
            against Stamina (skill) until it has less than 5 points or
            is otherwise closed.  The injury points start with 1 and
            are received 1 per watch until the infection has run its
            course, i.e. the result rolled.  The healing rate is
            modified by all running infections&#8217; points and the
            injury points of the wound in question.
          </p>
          <p>
            <em>Sleep deprivation</em> Every watch after a Stamina
            roll against -20 in hours, with a penalty of 1 per hour of
            not having slept.  For playability start rolling after 24h
            and the injury points are always 5.  The points are
            regained at the rate of 1 per hour of sleep.
          </p>
          <p>
            <em>Thirst</em> Every watch after a Stamina roll against
            -20, with a penalty of 1 for each liter of water that has
            not been drunk per day on average.  For playability start
            rolling after 3 days without water have passed.  Points
            are regained at the rate of 1 per hour.
          </p>
          <p>
            <em>Hunger</em> Every day after a Stamina roll against
            -20, with a penalty of 1 for each two pounds of food that
            have not been eaten per day on average.  For playability
            start rolling after 10 days without food have passed.
            Points are regained at the rate of 1 per hour.
          </p>
          <p>
            <em>Suffocation</em> Every minute without air a Stamina
            roll against 0 is required, with a penalty of 5 for each
            consecutive minute without air.  Points are regained at
            the rate of 1 per second once air is available again..

          the target receives on any active action (not awareness,
          healing, passive triggering, etc).  This penalty is reduced
          at 1 per second, but multiple attempts are allowed.
          Negative results are treated as severity for psionic
          episodes, severity as if the invoker was himself affected,
          including fade-out..

          Duration is Skill + n5 roll in minutes.  Return is always a
          Mental conflict, the &#8220;vacant&#8221; opponent is ML
          0. Preparation is Will attribute minutes - this is not a

          The duration is 20 seconds at 0, halved or doubled for every
          20 levels difference.  [2] reduces n5 fatigue points at 20,
          if positive. [3] reduces bloodloss at 20 with slow yield.

          The duration trajectory of an initiating trance is 20
          minutes at 0 and halved/doubled every 10 points.  The range
          for communication is governed by the Knowledge dimension,
          specific Ethereals are specific concepts, a known name
          grants a +10 bonus.  Control is the third trajectory, which
          also uses the knowledge dimension.  Any task must be within
          the ability of the ethereal or it will fail, also depending
          on the ability of the ethereal to subvert the intent.
          Ignoring a mental conflict is not within the ability of any
          ethereal.  Passive triggering involves a 5 minute
          daydreaming trance (assumed to happen automatically) with 0
          control and 0 communication.  An ethereal may attempt to
          intiate communication on its end, i.e. 5-add its skill.

          Detection range and duration are adjusted (as is strength)
          according to target.  Passive triggering works like

          The talent has three dimensions: Range, Duration, and
          Language.  The range is determined to reach the target and
          the other dimensions (trajectory) may be chosen by the user.
          The range is MLU in kilometers, and the duration is 30
          seconds, halved or doubled for every 20 levels difference.
          Language is the effectiveness a concept can be shared.  It
          is capped by a combined skill roll in a common language, if
          the recipient is willing. Otherwise it is capped by
          individual skill rolls.

          Encounter severity is rolled with a <em>p5</em>.  The result

            potential wound average can be imagined to have been
            caused by encountering a disease, an accident, such as a
            sprained ankle while walking, equipment break down, an
            attack by animals, or a bar room scuffle, and so on. The

          Overland travel is basically 30km a day or 3.5 days per
          100km.  The following table applies only to overland travel
          only in time and distance dimensions.  The modifiers apply
          only to overland travel in distance and time domains.
          Modifiers are cumulative.  The standard distance/time
          assumes a crop- or woodland, clear weather, on foot, and not
          on a road.  Modifiers are applied individually, e.g. speed
          is multiplied by 0.8 for a modifier of -20.  Order is
          irrelevant.

          The power level of artifacts is always twice the depletion
          roll target.  Charge depletion is a p5 roll after use and
          always obvious to those attuned but not anyone else.
          Individual powers are determined at 10 point intervals each
          in a predetermined order.  Later rolls will use the same
          order, at 0 the depletion target is discovered.
