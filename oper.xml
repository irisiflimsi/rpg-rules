        <p>
          This is a set of rules, which represent the aspects of a
          personal life as it is experienced in the setting.  The
          story-lines of these lives are separated from the
          rule-mechanics thereof.  Any situation that needs to be
          resolved with rules, such as conflicts, can be separated
          into different dimensions.  These dimensions are treated
          individually, but also interact.  This “dimensionality”
          avoids creating constraints in situations that should not
          have them from an inner-world perspective.  Attributes are
          properties of people that can be observed by knowledgeable
          observers in the world, just as occupational or professional
          skills are.  They are reasonable abstractions to be made
          inside the world.
        </p>
        <p>
          All out-world rules are condensed in this chapter.  Any
          competence in-world are abstracted on a five-star scale &#9733;
          through &#9733;&#9733;&#9733;&#9733;&#9733;, where exceptional values may go beyond.
          Minutes and other units more easily measured are applied
          regularly, but the star scale illustrates the
          difference.  How to turn this into numbers for out-world rule
          operations is detailed later.
        </p>
        <h4>Probabilities</h4>
        <p>
          A new type of die roll is introduced.  You roll a d5 until
          you get a 1 and then count the number of dice that did not
          show up a 1.  That is the same as the number of dice you
          actually rolled minus one.  This roll is dominated by the
          active character, or more generally, the actor.  It will
          generate positive numbers (or zero) and is termed the
          <em>positive</em> roll and abbreviated as <em>p5</em>.
          Example: Peter rolls 5, 3, 8, 10, 2 (in that order) on a
          d10.  He simulates the d5 by taking the result of a d10,
          halving it and rounding up.  He thus rolled 3, 2, 4, 5, 1,
          on a d5 effectively.  His p5 roll would be a 4.
        </p>
        <p>
          Of course, there is a <em>negative</em> roll that is
          associated with the passive resistance or the impediment. It
          is handled in the same way but the negative value is taken
          instead.  Thus in the above example, we would take -4 as
          result of a negative roll; therefore we can simply denote
          the roll as -p5.  These two numbers (from different rolls)
          are added.  The result will be a whole number, called
          <em>n5</em> (n for neutral).  An understanding of this rule
          is crucial, so we elaborate by listing the probabilities
          involved as well as some examples.
        </p>
        <p>
          The first row in the following table shows some of the
          results you can achieve when you roll a p5.  The second row
          shows the chance that you have of moving up one point
          (i.e. right) at any given point.  A p5 can never give a
          result below zero (0) and the chance to get "one more" is
          80%.  Note that this chance is always the same in each
          column.  The third row gives the percentage chance that you
          have of achieving the result in the corresponding first row
          instead of using the p5 mechanic.  These percentages you
          could use for rolling a d100 to get the same probabilities;
          maybe in order to reduce the number of dice to roll.  All
          but the first two columns of this third row are
          approximations.  The last column (with the ...) is somewhat
          special.  It combines the “higher” results and is often
          called exploding in other rule systems.  You could expand
          the table to infinity, if you wanted.  While the extensions
          of the first and second row are quite obvious, the third may
          not be.  It should be interpreted thus: if you roll 91-100,
          you need to roll again on this (third row of the) table,
          read of the result as before and then add 10 to the result.
          (For the mathematically inclined, this is a recursive
          definition, since it is possible that you roll 91-100 again,
          which forces you to roll on this table again and add 20 to
          the net result from the repeated application.  We will see
          this in the examples.)

        <p>
          This table only considers one roll, i.e. the positive.  You
          need to combine both into a single result in most cases.
          Two key observations useful in the future are: Zero (0) is
          the expectation value of the combined roll (n5) and five (5)
          for the single roll (p5).  When comparing numbers directly,
          say skills in a duel, a level 0 skill will only break even
          (or win) against a level 10 skill in 10% of all cases.  This
          is something that can be estimated in-world, and thus this
          rule lies at the border of in- and out-world rules.
        </p>
        <h4>Examples</h4>
        <p>
          To improve speed, several d10 may be rolled in ordered
          fashion.  Order them according to size or alphabetical color
          (e.g. black, blue, green, yellow) or in any other way you
          can remember.  With a d10 stop at 1 or 2.  Computer
          applications that make rolling as easy as pressing a button
          are easy to program.
        </p>
        <ul class="explain">
          <li>
            Assume you decided to use the third row of the table, then
            rolled a d100, and get a 24 on the positive roll.  This
            means a result of 1. The second roll for the negative part
            shows a 50, which results in 3. The net result therefore
            is a -2.
          </li>
          <li>
            A more exotic roll would be the sequence 96, 99, 93, 61 on
            the positive d100.  That result would be 34 (positive
            only).
          </li>
          <li>
            Using the standard method (i.e. the second row with a d5),
            the positive sequence on a d10 may show 3, 8, 10, 7, 9, 4,
            6, 3, 10, 10, 8, 4, 2 and the negative sequence shows 3,
            6, 9, 4, 4, 1.  The positive result is 12 and the negative
            -5 with a net result of +7.  If you decide that +7 is not
            precise enough, a roll of 3 and 5 on a d10 (each) gives
            are finer result of +7.35.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Active/positive and passive/negative are symmetrical.  If
          you imagine one character stealthily evading another, the
          first may interpret the rolls as himself actively evading
          against a passive observation of the surroundings.  That is,
          positive evasion vs. negative observation.  The second may
          interpret the rolls as him actively scrutinizing the
          vicinity against a passively hiding opponent.  That is,
          positive observation vs. negative evasion.  Either way, one
          roll (or a set of two rolls) will determine the same
          outcome.
        </p>
        <p>
          The rolls scale with difficulty.  Imagine that one character
          is particularly strong with a certain skill, but also
          attempts more difficult tasks.  Imagine the child character
          climbing the neighborhood tree and as a grown, experienced
          man climbing an overhanging cliff.  The child's climbing
          bonus of 5 against a difficulty addition of 7 for the tree
          gives the same probability distribution as the adult's bonus
          of 27 against the cliff's 29. It is easily seen why.
        </p>
        <h3 id="additions">Row Additions</h3>
        <p>
          Consider you have two skills of equal value that you want to
          add together.  If the effect of the two skills combined is
          as good as a skill of n points better, we call that
          Row-n-Addition.  This means that two people of the same
          skill with value x have a fair (50:50) chance of beating
          someone with a value x + n in that skill.  Taking the
          maximum of two separate skill rolls is similar to a
          Row-5-Addition as far as the probabilities are concerned.
          When using the tables, take the two numbers and use the
          (positive) difference of the two in the first row, to read
          of a result in the second, and add this result to the bigger
          to get the end result.  The “real” value to use when
          precision loss is important to you (rarely) is the
          math-formula <em>n*ln(1+exp(-d*ln(2)/n))/ln(2)</em>, where d
          is the difference.  Since we only intend to use n=3, 5,
          7, we provide tables for them.  You can also use the
          automated formula right here.  Looking at the tables, you
          see the reduction in effectiveness when adding smaller
          numbers to higher ones.

        <h3 id="s3kills">Skills</h3>
        <p>
          Skills govern all physical and mental activities, such as
          combat and spell-casting.  All skills are derived from
          character attributes and occupations and rated on open scale
          starting from zero (0) as the “default”, with only 10%
          reaching 10 points more.  This is inentionally identical
          with the p5 system of rolling dice.  The skill scale is
          open-ended ("exploding") as the p5 roll is, but humans
          generally do not get scores beyond 30.  Any activity can be
          organized as a skill.

        <h4>Skill Base</h4>
        <p>
          Skill Base (SB) represents a character’s natural affinity
          for a skill.  The SB for each skill can be calculated when
          necessary.  It is unlikely this varies after the beginning
          of play.  A skill is tested, when its application becomes
          useful or meaningful (a decision by the GM).  Some skills
          should be predetermined, because their application is hard
          to avoid.  Each skill entry below lists the attributes for
          its base.  To determine an SB, the attributes are averaged.
          If an attribute is listed twice, it is counted twice in the
          calculation.  Then directly subtract 15.  If the character’s
          Sunsign is listed, it increases SB by the indicated number –
          this is not averaged, but only applied directly as part of
          the SB.
        </p>
        <h4>Mastery Level</h4>
        <p>
          Mastery Level (ML) represents a character’s current
          competence at a specific skill; the higher the number, the
          more skillful.  MLs may be improved in the course of play
          and range from 0 to 30 usually.  Technically, there is no
          limit.
        </p>
        <p>
          Opening Mastery Level (OML) is listed with each skill.  This
          is the starting point for any skill ML.  Many skill start at
          zero (0) and can immediately be improved.  (in the fashion
          described below).  If the number is negative, any
          improvement of the skill can only happen with a teacher.
          Once an ML reaches zero (0) this restriction no longer
          applies.
        </p>
        <p>
          Effective Mastery Level (EML) is SB +<sub>5</sub> ML.  It
          can very with time.  Other bonuses and penalties may be added
          in concrete situations.
        </p>
        <p>
          Every skill in the list has an Occupation entry.  It shows a
          list of occupations with a percentage value each.  If an
          occupation is listed, then the OML listed is not used, but
          instead the Occupation ML times the percentage listed.
          Multiple occupations are combined through Row-5-Addition.
          <em>Example:</em> Juryn has an SB in Dancing of 4.  The
          occupation listing of 40 for his profession where he has
          level (ML) 20.  Thus his OML is 20 x 40% = 8 and his
          starting EML is SB +<sub>5</sub> ML = 8 +<sub>5</sub> 4 =
          11.
        </p>
        <h4>Specialties</h4>
        <p>
          Many skills can be divided into sub-skills or specialties;
          suggestions are given with some skills.  Characters may
          select specialties at any time.  The skill is then termed a
          group skill and included all (potential) specialties, even
          if unknown.  The specific specialty skill is opened at the
          current group ML.  Each specialty is developed as a separate
          skill.  A character may declare any number of specialties,
          but each is a separate skill.  <em>Example:</em> Bjorni has
          Sword skill at ML 14.  He decides to choose Broadsword as a
          specialty.  Sword and Broadsword are now two separate
          skills.  Bjorni must use his current Sword skill if he uses
          any other sword than Browadsword.
        </p>
        <p>
          Sometimes, only Specialties are given and the question
          arises, what ML in the Specialty implies on the skill group.
          Each specialty has a percentage value associated with it.
          (For a new Specialty, this must be decided upon by the GM.)
          Take that percentage of Specialty ML to get the group's ML.
          For example, a Mask/20% specialty in Woodcraft of 12 would
          imply a Woodcraft group score of 2.4, rounded down to 2.
        </p>
        <p>
          Note that this section applies to ML, not OML or EML.  EML
          is calculated regularly as for any skill and OML (if
          specialization is attempted at the outset) is as for the
          group skill.
        </p>
        <h4>Skill Testing</h4>
        <p>
          EML is modified for a concrete test, because of fatigue,
          injury, encumbrance, or difficult (or easy) circumstance
          <em>Example:</em> a character might normally have a minimum
          0 in Climbing.  However, climbing an ice cliff, with a
          broken arm, during a blizzard is probably impossible, and
          the GM may feel an ML of -30 is justified.  (This is roughly
          a 1 in 1000 chance of succeeding.)  If instead she was
          trying to decipher an alien script (without access to some
          sort of comparison) the ML may be at -50.  (This is roughly
          a 1 in 100,000 chance of succeeding.)  Factors affecting EML
          are sometimes specified in the skill description; otherwise
          GM discretion applies.
        </p>
        <p>
          When a character attempts to use a skill, n5 is rolled.
          Add/Subtract EML and any other modifiers the GM has noted.
          Some modifiers are "standard" and listed below, they will
          not be mentioned explicitely.  The GM will have decided upon
          a diffculty, often called the <em>negative</em> part.  This
          value is also subtracted from the roll and if the net result
          is not-negative, the skill has been successfully employed;
          if the roll is negative, the attempt has failed.  For
          example, if a PC declares the intent to perform a gymnastic
          feat, the GM would instruct the player to “test Acrobatics
          against difficulty 15.”  In cases where success or failure
          may not be obvious, the GM should make the roll secretly.
        </p>
        <p>
          It is often necessary to know the degree of success or
          failure.  The skill descriptions provide these so-called
          dimensions.  For skills, where no appropriate success levels
          are provided or for newly devised skills, estimate the
          effects by looking at the skills most closely related.
        </p>
        <p>
          When two characters use skills against each other, each
          character makes a p5 skill roll appropriate to the skill in
          question and the success levels are compared to give a net
          result.  The descriptions of the two skills should match for
          this net result (they should obviously the negative of each
          other).  The character with the highest success level
          “wins.”  If both characters achieve the same success level,
          the “stalemate” result of zero (0) applies.  If a tie is not
          appropriate to the situation, then decimal place may be
          rolled as explained in the initial section.
        </p>
        <h4>Penalties</h4>
        <p>
          Penalties are subtracted from the skill roll directly (not
          through Row-5-Addition).  To distinguish the standard
          penalties below, penalties assigned by the GM to reflect
          temporary handicaps are called <em>Special Penalties</em>.
        </p>
        <p>
          <em>Injury Penalty:</em> Combat, and other activities, may
          injure a character.  Each injury is rated in terms of Injury
          Levels: M5, S10, G15, and so on.  A character with, for
          example, one M3 and one S8 injury, has a total of sixteen
          (11) Injury Levels.  A character’s Injury Penalty is equal
          to the sum of all Injury Levels.  For more details about
          injuries, see Combat and Physician.  Usually injury
          penalties apply to all "physical" skills.  In some cases,
          part of the Injury penalty can be ignored.  For example,
          firing a bow with a injured foot is not impeded in the same
          manner as running.
        </p>
        <p>
          <em>Fatigue Penalty:</em> Using Psionic talents or certain
          other activity generates Fatigue Levels.  The GM may also
          assess Fatigue Levels for prolonged physical activity, such
          as when a character swims a swift river and then begins to
          scale a cliff without pausing to rest.  In general, one
          Fatigue Level is assessed for one minute of strenuous
          physical activity.  A character’s Fatigue Penalty is equal
          to the sum of all Fatigue Levels.  Every minute of Rest
          allows a character to remove one Fatigue Level.  Fatigue
          penalty applies to all skill applications.
        </p>
        <p>
          <em>Encumbrance Penalty:</em> Encumbrance Penalty is given
          by the Endurance Skill.  Note: This Encumbrance Penalty is
          only for humanoid creatures.  The Encumbrance Penalty for
          steeds is detailed in Mounted Combat (in the Combat
          chapter).
        </p>
        <p>
          <em>Astral Penalty:</em> Astrals of disembodied characters
          have a special penalty to the MLs of all skills, spells, and
          Psionic talents proportional to the portion of Aura they
          leave with the body.  If 5% of Aura is left behind, Astral
          skills are reduced by -2, if 10% of Aura is left behind,
          reduce by -4, and so on.  Some astral travelers prefer to
          leave larger portions of their Aura behind to give their
          body a better chance of resisting possession by an alien
          spirit.
        </p>
        <p>
          <em>Consecration Bonus:</em> This is actually not a penalty.
          It is still applied directly to relevant rituals, i.e. those
          for a deity to whom the ground is dedicated.  The bonus is
          equal to the consecrator's circle.  Under certain
          circumstances, other recipes may also use this consecration
          bonus, for instance, Concocting an alchemical, explosive
          compound in a laboratory dedicated to such volatile
          compounds.
        </p>
        <h4>Skill Development</h4>
        <p>
          At various times in the course of play, the GM decides a
          character has earned the chance to improve a skill.  Some
          skills may be developed by practice/study; some require
          training.  Execute each skill roll as follows: Roll n5.  If
          the roll is greater than current ML, increase ML by one (1);
          otherwise there is no increase.  This may also be
          interpreted as a "Learning skill" roll, where everybody has
          an EML of zero (0) and must match the difficulty of his
          current mastery.  I.e. the better you already are, the
          harder it is to improve.  To improve playability, award 1
          roll per gaming session.  Note that the difficulty is ML,
          not EML.
        </p>
        <p>
          Additional rolls may be awarded by the GM for extended idle
          periods, for instance in a winter camp.  Or the professional
          life of an NPC "off-screen" needs to be simulated.  In those
          cases, award approximately 10 rolls per month.
        </p>
        <p>
          Characters receive a bonus when being employed by a master
          with a higher ML.  A character getting personal instruction
          from a teacher or employer can add the skill of the teacher
          to his roll but must also subtract 10 due to the difficulty
          in teaching.  Be careful, which teacher you choose!
        </p>
        <p>
          Improving Specialties is a bit more elaborate.  Skills list
          specialties with a percentage value.  This percentage value
          gives the part of the whole group that this specialization
          comprises.  When the skill is improved (the skill group of
          all specialties) all improvement may be dedicated to the
          specialty instead.  For example, 20% Specialty could see a
          possible improvement of 5 points instead of 1 for the group
          and a 40% Specialty a poyyible improvement of 2.5 points.
          This implies that often fractions need to be maintained, to
          keep a consistent situation for specialties.  To actually
          improve a Specialty, start as if improving the group first.
          If the roll fails for the group, it also fails for the
          Specialty.  But assuming it succeeded for the group, You do
          not simply gain the multiple of points.  Instead, only 1
          point is gained.  For every further point to be gained from
          the possible improvement, a successful p5 roll must succeed
          against a difficulty of all points already gained this way.
          Any remaining fractions can be rolled as rounded to the
          nearest whole number or when “completed” by the next
          successful learning roll.
        </p>
        <p>
          Note: If at any time the whole skill group is developed
          simultaneously, any specialties that already have the lowest
          level reached are not improved.  By treating every specialty
          separately, continuing rolling after the lowest level is
          reached is possible.  This will then only increase the
          specialty by one point, obviously.
        </p>
        <p>
          <em>Example:</em> Assume Alosyn has an Acrobatics of 15 and
          decides to specialize in Vaults.  He manages to beat 15 one
          day, possibly with a teacher, to learn more.  Technically,
          he could be gaining 5 points, since Vault is a 20% specialty
          of Acrobatics.  The first point is already “approved” for
          Vault/16.  He then rolls p5 to see whether he can gain
          another point and with a 3 on his first p5, he now has
          Vaults/17.  The second p5 roll (for the third point) is only
          a 1, so no benefit is obtained.  The third roll is a 9,
          followed by a 6, which means his p5 is at least 2, which
          matches the two points already gained, so he is at Vault/18.
          The fourth roll is 3, 7, and 3 again! Thus his p5 is at
          least 3, which matches his three points already improved.
          He is now at Acrobatics/Vaults/19.  In the future to improve
          the specialty, 19 must be reached to improve Vaults in this
          manner again.  In all other respects he remains at
          Acrobatics/15.
        </p>
        <p>
          Gladiators are at 80%, Hunter/Trappers, Mercantylers,
          Pilots, and Weaponcrafters at 60% for their additional
          Weapon proficiencies.  Clerics open their church language at
          60%, if the same family, and 40%, if an alien family.  The
          church script is opened at 60%.  For those religions that
          have a Temple Private Tongue this opens to 60%.
        </p>
        <h4>Attribute Skills</h4>
        <p>
          Attributes used as skills serve two purposes.  First, it
          allows for the in-world attributes to become operational
          out-world, when rolling dice etc.  Second, it allows players
          to improve this skill as other skills.  The attribute itself
          serves as the SB for the skill.  Since unmodified attribute
          use is a case often encountered, a table is provided for
          easy reference and common values.  A side effect is that the
          average person turns out to have a skill value of around
          five (5).  Values below zero are only reachible through
          “bad” die rolls.
        </p>
        <h4>Dimensions</h4>
        <p>
          Dimensions are collected as common reference for the many
          skills that use them in more or less the same manner.

          In general, learning a recipe is a roll with the student's
          EML.  The student should have a quiet, dedicated space to
          study.  The <em>Dedicated Ground</em> modifier can be added
          to the EML directly.  The time cost assumes a student spends
          12 hours per day (3 watches) on the task, and study is
          continuous until the recipe is mastered.  The GM may assess
          penalties for interruptions in the study.  Some
          interruptions, like illness or a crisis, may justify
          aborting the study entirely.  Recipes have a circle rating,
          ranging from I - VI, or given as star rating. This is a
          direct numeric penalty when applying the recipe,
          e.g. performing the ritual.  For learning it represents the
          difficulty, see the star-rating dimension.  Now calculate
          the modifiers and make a Learn roll on the table below.  Any
          result below zero (0) means the time was spent in vain.

          Acrobatics Skill is tested when a character attempts a
          gymnastic feat that is more than a simple matter of native
          Agility.  These include vaults, somersaults, back-flips,
          twisting in mid-air to land on one’s feet, etc.  Acrobatics
          is a physical skill.  Rising takes as many seconds as listed
          in that dimension and during that period the character is
          considered prone.

          Tested when a character attempts to climb a difficult
          obstacle.  The GM assesses a climb by the dimensions in the
          table.  Additional modifiers should be made for slipperiness
          and availability of holds.  If the character has climbing
          gear (rope and grappling hook or spikes and mallet) and can
          use them, increase ML.  Speed is measured in feet per
          second.  A running total of vertical progress is kept to
          determine when the climb is complete, and the extent of any
          fall.  A single scale should only be rolled once, but any
          interruption, such as rest requires a new roll.  Any
          negative speed result (below -5) implies a fall.  Climbing
          speed can be increased at the price of increasing the risk.
          For each 5 levels of speed that are accepted as fall,
          increase ML by 1 point.  The following falling height is
          evenly distributed among the attempted climbing height.
          Climbing is a physical skill.

          Legerdemain (Sleight of hand) is tested when a character
          attempts to perform a feat of manual dexterity without being
          detected by observers or victims.  Examples include cutting
          a victim’s money-purse from behind or moving shells in a
          shell game.  The victim oppose with Awareness to detect the
          attempt.  If the victim is not paying attention, penalties
          apply.  If the result is negative the legerdemain is
          detected.  Awareness rolls may also be made for any
          potential witnesses.  Legerdemain is a physical skill.  The
          Awareness dimension is obviously modified by the “size” of
          the feat.  Shells or a coin are assumed for the listed
          penalty.  The Grope dimension is the time a trick takes, but
          mostly for larger objects – this is a combat dimension.

          Determines success when embalming a corpse against
          deterioration, and when preparing a corpse for
          burial/cremation.  The skill also includes familiarity with
          local rituals; since journeymen embalmers need to travel
          widely, this can result in quite an accumulation of
          knowledge.  Religious and/or cultural differences may be
          treated as specialties.  Civilized cultures take great care
          with their dead – embalming is a sign of respect and honor,
          and has serious emotional and religious overtones.  Most
          temples use master embalmers (either bonded or free) to
          oversee their burial rituals.  Embalming includes limited
          knowledge of practical Alchemy and Perfumery.  Embalmers
          know how to make incense and soap, for example.

          Load is the total weight of items carried or worn, generally
          clothing, armour, and weapons, but perhaps also a trinket or
          two.  Armour and weapons are listed on the Combat Profile.
          Total Load is recalculated as items are acquired or
          discarded.  Detailed lists of items may be made on separate
          sheets if necessary.  Encumbrance Penalty is the effect of
          carried weight on a character’s physical activities.  It is
          equal to Weight in lbs times Load factor.

          When holding breath (for more than a few seconds) Fatigue is
          not recovered, as is generally the case while fatigue is
          accumulated.  The Breath factor is a factor of the fatigue
          accumulation rate.  A factor of 10 means that physical
          activity that normally generates 1 level per minute, now
          does 1 every 6 second.  Remember that the fatigue accrued
          must be used as modifier for the next time interval.
          Endurance is a physical skill.

          The basic distribution presented in the in-world chapter for
          attributes can be used to randomly generate them.  They can
          also be a choice, depending on how the group wants to
          generate characters.  It can also be anything inbetween,
          such as partly rolling, partly choosing; first rolling, then
          modifying; or a point based system, where good attributes
          are "bought" and/or "bad" attributes provide additional
          points to spend.  For simulation purposes, the out-world
          values should be recorded by the players, while the
          characters themselves are considered to only be aware of
          values available in the in-world chapter.  You may create
          veterans with these rules.
        </p>

            <em>Strength, Stamina, Dexterity, Agility, Eyesight,
            Hearing, Smell, Aura, Will:</em> They can all be treated

          </li>
        </ul>
        <h4>Friends &#0038; Enemies</h4>
        <p>
          Each character generates a number of contacts equal to the
          character’s Age divided by five.  These contacts are in
          addition to any close relatives and current work associates.
          The GMs decides on the details, including Relationship and
          Loyalty.

        <h4>Equipment &#0038; Funds</h4>
        <p>
          Although most income is spent simply to survive, veterans
          have accumulated some savings.  Assume a veteran character
          has accumulated 10% of total income.  For example, a
          bonded-master Ostler, with ten years experience has (936d x
          10 years x 10%) = 936d available to spend on items or save.
        </p>
        <h3 id="o3ccupations">Occupations</h3>
        <p>
          An occupation resolves to 5 for each &#9733; that is taught.
          If multiple occupations are learned, they add through
          Row-5-Addition, when applicable.  In particular, Parent
          Occupation may immediately added, when it is the same as
          vocational Occupation.
        </p>
        <p>
          <em>Chandlers</em> have three craft occupations at 5.  Craft
          occupations are marked with asterisk (*) in the table above.
        </p>
        <p>
          <em>Gladiators</em> and <em>Hunter/Trappers</em> have
          expertise in three weapons.  <em>Mercantylers, Pilots</em>
          and <em>Weaponcrafters</em> have one weapon proficiency.
        </p>
        <h4>Optional Skills</h4>
        <p>
          All newly created characters have five option points to open
          new skills or improve existing skills.  Remember that most
          skills have a score of zero, so opening a (reasonable) skill
          or improving an open skill is the same.  For each option
          point five points are added through Row-5-Addition.
          Successive improvement of the same skill work the same.
        </p>
        <p>
          A veteran character receives three option points per year of
          experience; five years experience equals 5 x 3 = 15 OP.
          These points should be expended as other option points.
        </p>
        <h4>Shek-Pvar</h4>
        <p>
          Every Shek-Pvar adds the stars of his Chantry and his Aura.
          During character creation these are his Spell Option Points.
          All Convocational spells cost 1 SOP per level, and all
          Neutral spells cost 2 SOP per level.  For detailed spell
          descriptions, see HârnMaster Magic.  Beginners cannot spend
          more than one third of their spell OPs to learn neutral
          spells.
        </p>
        <h4>Clerics</h4>
        <p>
          Clerics may learn invocations by spending 20 Ritual Option
          Points.  All invocations cost 1 ROP per Circle.  Invocations
          specific to each religion can be found in the various deity
          articles.  See Religion.
        </p>
        <h4>Military</h4>
        <p>
          To initially enlist in a military unit, a character is
          assessed, with the following additions to an n5 roll.

        <h4 id="morality">Morality</h4>
        <p>
          Individuals should have a moral compass.  Morality is a
          measure of unselfishness.  The following serves as a
          guideline of the diversity found in Hârnworld, but is by no
          means exhaustive.  Sindarin tend towards the “higher” moral
          standards.
        </p>
        <p>
          Customary description of Morality include: <em>Diabolical,
          Unscrupulous, Corruptible, Law-Abiding, Principled,
          Exemplary.</em> They are not always applied correctly when
          dealing with enemies or friends.  Moral description from
          others tend to be worse when describing an enemy.
        </p>
        <h4 id="sexuality">Sexuality</h4>
        <p>
          People have a descriptive sexuality.  The distribution of
          sexuality in Hârn is roughly 90% heterosexual, 5% bi-sexual
          and 5% homosexual.  Other forms of sexuality may exist but
          are hidden.
        </p>
        <h4 id="species">Species</h4>
        <p>
          Although Hârn has many exotic creatures, Humans, Sindarin
          and Khuzdul are by far the most commonly encountered.  The
          population distribution on Hârn is approximately Human
          (97%), Sindarin (1%), and Khuzdul (1%).
        </p>
        <h4 id="gender">Gender</h4>
        <p>
          Among encountered humans 48% are male, among Sindarin 45%,
          and among Khuzdul 75%.  (Other individuals encountered are
          female.)
        </p>
        <h4 id="birthdate">Birthdate</h4>
        <p>
          Every day of the year (360) has an equal probability of
          being the birthday of a random person.  In other words: they
          are evenly distributed.  Names of calendar months are
          readily available in other sections of Hârnworld.
        </p>
        <h4 id="sunsign">Sunsign</h4>
        <p>
          Sunsign is a major factor for skill-affinity, but all
          sunsigns have advantages and disadvantages.  Sunsign is
          determined by birthdate.  The first two and last two days of
          each sign are termed the cusp: a person born on the 1st
          of Ilvin is termed a Tai-Skorus Cusp (the actual sunsign is
          named first).  Those born on the cusp enjoy the benefits of
          either sign.  Hârnic astrology reveals the Pvaric nature of
          Kelestia.  Personality descriptions for each of the twelve
          signs of the zodiac are given in HârnPlayer.  The
          personality of a person born on the cusp would be a blend
          of the two signs.

          the Social Class of a randomly encountered individual.  For
          some cultures a random result does not make sense
          (e.g. Slaves in Kaldor).  Refer to the relevant HârnWorld

          About a third of all individuals encountered are first-born.
          Of the remainder, a third is a second-born and so on.  For
          Sindarin and Khuzdul 50% are first-born and of the
          remainder, 50% are second-born instead.  The sex and age of
          each sibling may be determined accordingly, with a 60% of
          each still being alive.  To determine the number of
          siblings, determine the rank of the last sibling as before,
          but which obviously must come after the indiviual's rank

            together, 20% see either the father or the mother absent
            (desertion, divorce, etc.).  In the remaining 20% either
            the father or mother is dead, in half of the cases the

          </li>

            <b>20%</b> of all people were fostered; they lived with

            Guilded apprentices are usually fostered with their
            masters, as are squires training for knighthood.  Poor
            families, especially those with only one parent, commonly
            foster one or more children with a relative or neighbor.
            Fostered children are usually aware of their parents’
            identity.

          <li>

            generally only done if both parents are dead, but there
            are exceptions if parental consent is given.  Adopted

            <b>15%</b> are Bastards. Parents never married, most
            likely because the father was of a higher social class, or
            one (or both) parents were already married or
            betrothed. Acknowledgement happens only in a third of all
            cases. A bastard usually lives with his mother, but may
            reside with father if acknowledged.

          It is the habit of the upper classes to spread their oats
          throughout the lower classes; if unacknowledged, the real
          father may never be known, but then again, he may be someone
          of wealth and power who could be helpful.  Acknowledging a
          bastard is a significant act; the admission can have
          important emotional ramifications for both parents,
          especially to their respective spouses.  In families where
          there is property and/or titles to inherit, acknowledged
          bastards usually follow the youngest legitimate heir, but
          dynamic characters may do better, especially if they happen
          to be a father’s eldest son and the legitimate heirs are
          weak.  Many a dynastic bonfire has been ignited with such a
          spark.

        <h4 id="estrangement">Estrangement</h4>
        <p>
          Estrangement measures a person’s popularity in the clan,
          tribe, and/or family.  It has a significant effect on
          opportunities, including any inheritance.  Being the eldest
          child of a knight is less advantageous if he hates
          you. Siblings with different estrangements are often jealous
          of each other; this can produce interesting family politics.

        <p>
          A person’s relationship to the Clanhead is often more
          important than to parents.  Hârnic clans tend to be large.
          Some live in close proximity.  Some number in the thousands
          and are widely dispersed.  Wealthy and noble clans are often
          extended.  Poor clans are likely to be smaller, especially
          if they live in major settlements.  Poor families in the
          same town or district may have the same clan name, but have
          been out of touch for generations.  Except for outcast
          characters, the clanhead can always provide shelter and a
          hot meal.  In some cultures, maternal relationships are more
          important.
        </p>
        <p>
          The hypothetical census would have for a person: 15% father
          or mother as the clan head, 10% a cousin, 25% an aunt or
          uncle. All others (50%) identify the clanhead as distant.
        </p>
        <h4 id="height">Height</h4>
        <p>
          The average height of a Hârnic male human is 68 inches with
          a variance of 5.83. The average is modified: Sindarin: -3",
          Khuzdul: -14".  Human females: -2", Sindarin females: 1".
          Ivinian +1”, nobility +2”, urban poor -2”.  Such
          measurements are often made by Physicians, while averages
          and variance thereof are only calculated by excentric
          scholars.

        <h4 id="weight">Weight</h4>
        <p>
          On Hârn, the "optimal" weight of a person depends on his

          usually published in a yearly almanach.

          Physical ability is assessed by the military (including
          their physicians) and a five-star rating is used.
          Non-humans often have their own physiology - that is
          recognized in the statistics.  (The scale is extended to six
          stars for exceptional non-humans.)
        </p>
        <p>
          <em>Agility</em> moves the body. Agility is useful for
          warriors, seamen, and dancers.
        </p>
        <p>
          <em>Dexterity</em> is the ability to manipulate objects with
          the hands. Dexterity is important for warriors and
          cut-purses.
        </p>
        <p>
          <em>Stamina</em> is the general physiological
          condition. Stamina determines for how long wound healing
          takes and also affects disease and poison resistance.
        </p>
        <p>
          <em>Strength</em> is sheer physical power, a crucial
          attribute for combat and other physical activities, which is
          why military types usually assess it.  It is common
          knowledge that additional weight leads to increased
          strength.  However, this has not been measured accurately
          and not any weight leads to an increase in strength.  It is
          also unknown whether the same relationship to weight exists
          for Sindarin and Khuzdul.

          Physicians collect the data for the senses, often diseases
          or poisons affect the senses and their origin can be
          determined by gauging their effects.  A five-star rating is

          <em>Eyesight</em> is the ability to see in daylight.  Except
          for nocturnal creatures (like Gargun) eyesight is reduced in
          the dark and that affects all activity requiring vision.
        </p>
        <p>
          <em>Hearing</em> is used to sense sound.  This is essential

        <p>
          <em>Smell</em> estimates sensitivity to odor and taste.
          This can be useful for hunting and/or tracking, and may warn
          of danger.  Of course, in a medieval town, a keen sense of
          smell may well be a curse.

          The Sindarin are immune to human diseases, but more are
          considered “Sterile” than other species.  The list is not

            <em>Addiction:</em> Individuals consume some substance
            like alcohol or a drug.  The urge is hard to overcome in
            certain situations.  When under the influence, people may
            become unconscious, injure themselves, etc.

            <em>Albinism:</em> Pallid complexion, white hair, red
            eyes.  Viewing bright light causes intense eye pain.
            Albinos sunburn very easily.  Some people consider them
            very attractive.

            <em>Allergy:</em> Common allergies are to pollen, hair,
            fur, feathers, wool, bee stings, or to foods such as eggs,
            milk, cereals, or shellfish.  When the substance is
            nearby, a person suffers from sneezing, wheezing, and
            coughing.  This results in reduced abilities until the
            allergy source is avoided or removed.  Eating allergic
            foods can cause serious illness or death - consider this

          <li>
            <em>Leg:</em> One leg is missing or deformed.  Such an

            <em>Leprosy:</em> Body covered with sores/scabs.  Pain
            sensitivity is reduced.  Comliness is reduced.  Leprosy is
            contagious.
          </li>

          <li>
            <em>Parasites:</em> Worms, fleas, lice, etc.  These are

          Shek-Pvar and Priests collect the statistics for these
          attributes.  They are not willingly shared, only few
          scholars have access to the combined treasure of these
          numbers.  A five-star rating is used.  (The scale is
          extended to six stars for exceptional non-humans.)
        </p>
        <p>
          <em>Intelligence</em> is the ability to reason and
          articulate.  Often the following descriptions are used for
          the star scale:
        </p>
        <ul class="explain">
          <li>&#9733; = Absent-minded, moronic, stupid</li>
          <li>&#9733;&#9733; = Forgetful, slow-witted</li>
          <li>&#9733;&#9733;&#9733; = Average</li>
          <li>&#9733;&#9733;&#9733;&#9733; = Good memory, clever</li>
          <li>&#9733;&#9733;&#9733;&#9733;&#9733; = Excellent memory, genius</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          <em>Aura</em> is Psionic concept.  Hârnic philosophers
          believe that all living things have Aura and that the
          physical body is simply a place where the immortal spirit
          currently resides.  High Aura indicates high psychic
          ability, and is the most important attribute for Psionics
          and magic (although Will and Intelligence are also vital).
        </p>
        <p>
          <em>Will</em> encapsulates mental strength, tenacity, and
          patience.  A person with low Will lacks confidence, panics
          easily, and has difficulty with tedious tasks.  Those with
          high Will are resolute, confident, and stubborn.

          Phobias, manias, and other mental disorders can be
          disruptive.  The list of mental disorders is not
          comprehensive.  Mental disorders of the same type may have
          different severities.  A phobia is an irrational
          fear/aversion.  When likely to be stimulated by an
          appropriate situation, a person's Will is tested to
          determine if the phobia can be resisted or not.  If relief
          is impossible, the person may faint, become hysterical, go
          berserk, etc.  A mania is an irrational fascination,
          obsession, or compulsion, usually to excess.  An individual
          with Pyromania takes every opportunity to start a fire; with
          Hydrophobia he is unlikely to enjoy swimming, boating, etc.
          Severity of the disorder is, of course, relevant in the
          actions that are taken.  Some disorders are only latent and
          the level of Severity is unknown.  It is quite possible for
          someone with Acrophobia to climb a mountain with no
          problems, but panic sitting atop a twenty feet wall.
          Phobias are irrational.
        </p>
        <p>
          The list is compiled by specialized physicians but also by
          Savorya Shek-Pvar.  A prevalence is not given, nor is the
          chance of multiple disorders given.  The list is considered
          harmful, if it were to leak into the public.  Translations
          are available for physicians not versed in scholarly
          tongues but sufficient funds.

          * The person may change personality in stressful situations,
          based on his Will.  The primary personality is neurotic and
          totally unaware of the secondary personality. The latter, on
          the other hand, is aware of the primary personality and
          often takes desperate actions to try and overcome the
          neurosis of that personality.

        <h4 id="deity">Deity</h4>
        <p>
          Gods or goddesses may be worshiped (however laxly) by any
          person.  While people may respect and acknowledge the
          existence of any number of deities, they usually only follow
          one, although it is possible to change religion.  The
          religion a person may encounter depend on a lot of
          circumstances and depends on the birthplace.  Available
          choices are presented in other Hârnworld publications, which
          also consider culture and social class.  Most people tend to
          follow the deity of their parents or guardians.
        </p>
        <p>
          While there are chivalrous worshipers of Morgath and corrupt
          Laranians, people tend to be more satisfied if their morals
          matches that of their deity.  Churches and clerics, unaware
          of an individual’s true morality, may be fooled.
        </p>
        <p>
          People may faithfully ascribe to two or more religions,
          provided the deities are not diametrically opposed.  Some
          miscreants may try to subvert an opposing religion, but this
          is not faithful.  Some rare people may consider themselves
          godless.  Divine intervention is another word for miracle.
          However, the acts of deities should never be confused with
          spells, which are the acts of mages.

          A simple peasant may possess little more the clothes worn, a
          knapsack containing their worldly possessions, credentials
          when appropriate, and a money-belt.  Most travel afoot, but
          nobles require a horse.  A person's wealth is largely
          dependent on family wealth, which is relative to social
          status.  The census data compiled by the crowns provide the
          following table and shows three levels of wealth within each
          social class. The value given amounts to what a person is
          assumed to possess when becoming of age, i.e. a responsible
          subject of the souvereign.  This wealth may be used on items
          from the Price List on HârnPlayer and the Weapon and Armour
          tables.  Estrangement can also influence funds.

          Squires are traditionally equipped by their lord when
          knighted.  This includes weapons, armour, and a good steed.
          Family wealth above does not include this.  Very few Hârnic
          folk own property.  Rural freemen and serfs rent cottages
          and land from the lord.  City homes are mostly owned by a
          few wealthy folk and rented to poorer citizens.  Only
          established urban guildsmen can hope to buy a private home.
          Most rural households own a few sheep or goats, perhaps a
          cow.  Some families raise pigs which are prolific breeders.
          Wealthier households own oxen and rent them for village work
          in exchange for food and labor.  Only the wealthiest of
          peasants can afford to keep a bull or a horse.
        </p>
        <p>
          Clothes should suit a person’s station.  A tunic, leggings,
          hat, and sandals are bare essentials.  Some folk wear a robe
          or gown instead of a tunic.  Travelers normally have a
          knapsack containing portable tools of their trade.  A
          weaponcrafter, for example, must own hammers and tongs, but
          carrying an anvil is unlikely.  Nearly everyone carries some
          fire-making tools (tinderbox, or flint and steel) and a
          strip of cloth for a towel, bandage, or arm-sling.  A
          waterskin is also essential.
        </p>
        <p>
          Nearly everyone owns a knife or dagger.  Clubs, bows,
          hatchets, slings, and staves are also common.  Other weapons
          are expensive and “Bearing Arms” in HârnPlayer should be
          consulted.  Few young adults can afford good armour.
          Military individuals are mostly equipped by their unit, but
          knights on feudal service must bring their own weapons,
          armour, and steed.
        </p>
        <p>
          Proving identity can be difficult on Hârn.  A travelling
          person should have papers to prove guild rank (if any)
          and/or a letter of introduction from a prominent person such
          as a lord of the manor, or a cleric or sheriff, etc.  Many
          guilds issue a badge or tattoo to prove rank. The expensive
          weapons and armour carried by knights speak for themselves.

        <h1 id="occupations">Occupations</h1>
        <p>
          An occupation largely determines the skills a person learns
          during adolescense and the opportunities that follow, at
          least initially.  Occupation is not necessarily a life
          commitment.  Jobs can change during a life, although this
          might involve lengthy re-training.  The occupations
          available depend mainly on Social Class, although birthplace
          and natural talent (attributes) may open or close some
          doors.  Some vocations (Knight and Herald) are only
          available to high-born individuals; some require exceptional
          natural talent.  Birthplace is also relevant; a person
          born in land-locked Kaldor may have a hard time running away
          to the sea.
        </p>
        <p>
          Determining the chances for the occupation of a random
          individual is hard, since no such census data is available.
          The outcome would largely depend on Social Class, which
          depends on the occupation of one’s parents. Some
          children follow the same occupation or choose another at GM
          discretion. The eldest born survivor, especially if a
          favorite, would be expected to follow the family
          occupation. Later born offspring have more choice,
          especially if unpopular. As a reference, the occupations a
          person can choose in Hârnic society are listed, with average
          income and years of apprenticeship.

          <em>Guilded Occupations:</em> Wages given are for Bonded
          Masters; room and board may also be provided.  The employer
          would bear the additional cost of providing materials and
          supplies, but tools are owned by the master.  A skilled
          mason-architect building a new castle, or an exquisite sword
          craftsman, could earn fees up to six times higher, but such
          incomes are rare.  Apprentices receive room &#0038; board
          and sometimes get pocket money from generous masters.
          Journeymen receive 30-60% of a master's wages, depending on
          experience, plus room and board.  Freemasters have variable
          incomes because demand for their services can vary.  See:

          <em>Unguilded Occupations:</em> Wages given are for average
          experienced workers; others might earn more/less depending

          Occupational rating is on the typical five-star scale.  When
          completing an apprenticeship, a person is assumed to have
          advanced to &#9733;&#9733;&#9733; through his training.  The
          occupation of the parent will usually convey a &#9733;
          rating.  Attributes play a role in selecting a suitable
          profession.  There are practical and common sense limits.  A
          warrior with a sufficiently high Aura can certainly learn
          spells, but doing so requires years learning the mysteries
          and ways of magic.

          People interested in a clerical career must visit a temple
          or abbey to be interviewed by the Master of Acolytes, or
          find a priest to sponsor the application.  An appropriate
          Morality and a minimum Ritual knowledge are generally
          required, but a large donation to temple coffers may
          overcome a deficiency in talent.  Acolyte training takes
          seven years.  The church is a popular career for the second
          (or later) sons of nobility, or for devout characters of
          lesser birth.  The complex mysteries of church doctrine are
          described in <em>Religion</em>.
        </p>
        <p>
          Each church has holy scriptures written in a particular
          language and script: Churches teach this language and script
          to all Acolytes.  Three churches perform their ceremonies
          and rituals in a private (secret) language in addition to
          their church language.

          Newly ordained clerics start play knowing some Ritual
          Invocations.  All Common invocations rated at Circle II are
          taught to clerics.  Clerics may learn other invocations.
          Also see Religion.  Clerics usually complete their training
          with little of material value.  Acolytes are unpaid and the
          simple monastic life they lead in training does not
          encourage the accumulation of worldly goods.  Newly ordained
          clerics typically own a wool robe, linen tunic and hose,
          leather sandals or boots, a dagger or staff, a simple ring
          denoting their status, and a purse of 6-36 pence.

          Shek-Pvar belong to one of six ancient and esoteric
          sub-orders (convocations).  Each convocation stresses on
          certain Pvaric principles because some conflict with others.
          Most Hârnic Shek-Pvar reside in Melderyn.  Each convocation
          has its own chantries.  Chantries vary in quality according
          to a five-star scale.  The best are difficult to find and
          enter.  A high Aura is required, but most applicants can
          improve their chance of acceptance if they have the right
          family connections, sufficient funds to bestow, or an
          appropriate recommendation.

          When Mavari learn how to attune to their element, they are
          taught to let a small amount of Principle exist within their
          Aura.  Attunement must be done slowly and carefully, and it
          takes months before sufficient Principle can reside within
          the Aura to allow spells to be cast.  Mages refer to this
          Aura-resident Principle as their Foundation.  With time and
          practice, Foundations can be increased in size to
          accommodate Principle from other convocations.  A gifted
          Mavari will sometimes join a convocation in opposition to
          his Sunsign.  This gives him an advantage when learning
          spells of other convocations in the future, although it will
          impede his early career.  A Shek-Pvar Satia-Mavari departs
          from their chantry after five to seven years apprenticeship.
          Masters expect Mavari to spend the majority of their time
          learning spells of their own convocation.

          A military career provides good weapon skills, useful social
          contacts, and a good opportunity for advancement in society.
          Of course, it might also be dangerous.  Only individuals
          with good Strength, Stamina, and Will should consider this

            unarmoured horse, or used en masse in battle.
          </li>
          <li>
            <em>Medium Horse [MH]</em> Riders are well-armoured in

          Because of the pervasive military influence of the Azeryan
          Empire, the Azeri names for military ranks are in common use
          throughout Northwestern Lythia.
        </p>
        <p>
          Five enlisted ranks are in general use.  These are rarely
          filled by nobles, who would consider them beneath their
          station.  <em>Molak:</em> the common soldier.  Status and
          remuneration vary according to special skills and unit type.
          <em>Arkalin:</em> commands a manus of five men; himself and
          four Molaks.  <em>Melbrin:</em> commands a decad of ten men;
          himself, one Arkalin, and eight Molaks.  <em>Molarin:</em>
          commands a company of twenty men; himself, one Melbrin, two
          Arkalins, and sixteen Molaks.  A cavalry Molarin commands a
          squadron.  <em>Armolarin:</em> the most senior Molarin in a
          centad.  He is the principal liaison between officers and
          men, and is often the “real” commander of a Centad.
        </p>
        <p>
          Officers are gentlemen.  A commoner rising to officer rank
          is also invariably knighted.  There is widespread belief
          that leaders must be noble, although there is no law to that
          effect.  Five officer ranks exist. <em>Hulhurin:</em> junior
          staff officer, and deputy commander of a Centad.  May also
          command an auxiliary company.  <em>Hethrin:</em> commander
          of a Centad, or a Cohort staff officer.  <em>Kurlin:</em>
          senior staff officer, and deputy commander of a Cohort.
          <em>Berheth:</em> commander of a Cohort.  <em>Tharin:</em>
          commander of a Legion, which has two or more Cohorts.
        </p>
        <p>
          Light horse units have the same ranks as infantry officers,
          except there is no Decad command.  Medium and Heavy horse
          units differ at Manus and Squadron level.
          <em>Chalisir:</em> any trooper in a medium or heavy horse
          unit.  A manus will be commanded by a senior Chalisir.
          <em>Kephiri:</em> commander of a Squadron of medium or heavy
          horse.
        </p>
        <p>
          Most units let individuals enlist at age 16, and discourage
          those over 30.  Interested individuals must contact a unit.
          The recruiting officer will ask about the person’s
          background, and military experience.  A recommendation from
          someone in the unit might be helpful, and some Knight units
          (including the Khuzdul High Guard) require applicants to be
          noble.
        </p>

          Having completed four years of service, soldiers may now
          elect to continue their military career or muster-out of the
          army to follow some other occupation.  Guard and legionnaire
          units require a one year contract at the end of which a
          Re-enlistment Incentive may be offered to sign up for
          another twelve months.  Irregular units have less formal
          contracts, most likely just a handshake or an oath, but the
          effect is the same.

          Military wages are traditionally paid quarterly, but are
          listed monthly for comparison with other incomes.
          Considering the danger, wages are low, but armies offer
          various other benefits, and sometimes deliver them.  These
          include food and shelter, and the opportunity to collect
          booty.  The wage table gives monthly base pay.  Elite units
          may get more, although some elite units in which men serve
          for honor may get less.  It is not unusual for a soldier to
          work long stretches followed by long furloughs.  Armies are
          generous with (unpaid) leave in peacetime.  All foot units
          know the ranks Molak, Arkalin, Melbrin, Molarin, and
          Armolarin.  The pay listed is for Molaks, every next rank
          has a pay increase of 1/4 over the previous rank on the
          Molak’s base.  E.g. a Longbow Melbrin earns a monthly 108d.
          Light Horse units have the ranks Molak, Arkalin, Molarin,
          and Armolarin and progress 96d, 120d, 180d, and 216d.
          Medium and Heavy Horse units only have the ranks of Chalasir
          and Kephiri, of which the Kephiri earn +96d monthly over the
          base pay for Chalasirs.

          Traditionally, a soldier may keep 2/3 of booty collected,
          giving 1/3 to the next highest rank, who gives 1/3 to the
          next highest rank, and so on.  High ranking officers can get
          very rich with this scheme.  Cash bonuses are sometimes
          given for long, distinguished service, or as a re-enlistment
          incentive.  There is no typical amount, although a bonus
          would rarely exceed a month's pay.
        </p>
        <p>
          Standing armies typically offer land grants to soldiers
          after twenty years service.  Monetary pensions are rare, but
          “half-pay for life” might be awarded to a soldier who has
          distinguished himself in some way.  When a soldier is maimed
          in the course of duty, he is discharged with a lump sum
          bonus rather than a pension.  The amount is two to twelve
          months pay, depending on the nature of the injury and wealth
          of the unit.  Few armies provide survivor benefits.  A bonus
          of about six month's pay might be provided to a widow in
          exceptional cases.  More commonly, the deceased's comrades
          will make a collection.

          A cohort, ideally, consists of two centads of light foot,
          one of medium foot and one of light footbowmen (shortbow or
          longbow).  In addition, there are often auxiliary units,
          such as companies of engineers (sappers), artillery (siege
          engines), light cavalry (scouts), medical, ostlers,
          weaponcrafters, etc.  In practice a Cohort may contain from
          two to six Centads, each consisting of two to eight
          Companies.  The economic realities of manning, equipping,
          and supporting military units have always overwhelmed the
          neat organizational plans of staff officers.  Each centad
          ideally has 100 men, grouped into 5 companies, lead by a
          Hethrin.  Each company consists of 2 decads and each decad
          has 2 manus.
        </p>
        <p>
          Some states, like Azeryan, group their cohorts into legions.
          The ideal Azeryani legion consists of four cohorts plus
          various auxiliary or reserve units attached to the legion
          HQ.  On Hârn, legions exist only in the Thardic Republic
          where they tend to be little more than large cohorts.
        </p>
        <p>
          Full strength cavalry cohorts are rare.  It is simply too
          expensive to maintain such units in peacetime.  The cohort
          shown, which exists only in the dreams of Lord Marshals,
          contains one centad of regular light horse, two centads of
          feudal medium horse, and one centad of feudal heavy horse.
          From mid-spring to mid-autumn, one or two squadrons of each
          feudal centad might be manned by knights doing their
          military service.  Other squadrons would be inactive until a
          military emergency arises.  Feudal units might be virtually
          devoid of personnel in winter.  Formally., a squadron
          consists of 10 riders, and is split into two manus.  Most
          cavalry tends to be deployed in small units of squadron or
          centad strength and massed only for battle.  There are, of
          course, exceptions, such as the large bodies of horse
          defending Shorkyne and Trierzon's borders.  Imperial cavalry
          tends to be mostly light.  Azeryan, for example, uses
          cavalry in a supporting role (scouts and skirmishers), as
          does Tharda.  This is mostly due to the lack of a feudal
          societal class.  The Azeryani do, however, hire foreign
          knights to serve in some special forces.  Logistical
          problems are different for cavalry units.  Auxiliary forces,
          weaponcrafters, ostlers, transport, engineers, and the like
          are all slower than cavalry, and tend to get left behind.
          Units, even small ones, may have their own "field
          households" (messes) in tow. These too, may straggle.

        <p>
          Healing is a widely-practiced art.  Clerics of Peoni have
          considerable medical expertise.  Nearly all lay-folk,
          especially in rural areas, have some understanding of herbal
          remedies.  Most warriors know emergency treatments for
          battlefield wounds.
        </p>
        <p>
          Those who practice the healing arts full-time generally
          belong to the Society of Physicians, a loosely-organized
          guild.  The Society does not care much about preserving its
          monopoly, and makes little attempt to maintain standards.
          Some masters are incompetent quacks, while others are
          highly-skilled surgeons.  However, a physician who maims or
          kills too many patients will soon encounter difficulties
          from outraged friends and relatives.
        </p>
        <p>
          Master physicians may take on as many apprentices as they
          wish.  There are no journeymen in the Society, nor bonded
          masters in the normal sense; masters may take employment as
          they see fit.  Many masters are associated with the church
          of Peoni, and some dabble in the arcane arts.  Most
          physicians confine themselves to the treatment of minor
          ailments.  Fees vary dramatically, sometimes according to
          the skill brought to bear, but mostly according to
          reputation.  Fees typically range from 3d for fairly basic
          first aid to 240d for “major” surgery.  Medicines, provided
          by the Apothecaries’ Guild, and hospital care (rare) can
          double or triple fees.
        </p>
        <p>
          When people get sick or wounded, they are advised to get the
          best first aid available, and then seek someone with a
          decent Physician Mastery as soon as possible.  Carrying a
          good supply of bandages and herbal remedies is always a good
          idea.  Hârnic doctors are far more competent than their
          medieval Terran colleagues.  They know, for example, it’s a
          good idea to keep open wounds and surgical instruments as
          clean as possible, although they do not know why.  One
          theory has to do with fiery, invisible elementals which can
          be driven off with hot water.  If no doctor is available any
          friend can administer treatment and self-treatment is always
          possible (modified by Will at GM discretion).

        <h1 id="psi">Psionics</h1>
        <p>
          Psionic talents are native, psychic abilities some people
          possess, but may be unaware of.  Since it requires years of
          practice to properly employ Psionic talents, they are within
          the sphere of the Guild of Arcane Lore.  Those endowed may
          notice some of the odd effects produced by their latent
          Psionic abilities to &#9733; (one star on the five-star scale).
          Some learn of their ability when another person with a
          developed talent is able to sense and inform them of its
          presence.  Some talents are never discovered and remain
          dormant forever.  Individuals who wish to became a mage are
          more likely to be accepted as an apprentice if they have an
          active Psionic talent.
        </p>
        <p>
          Psionic Talents at &#9733; are dormant.  Anyone with a
          dormant talent is unaware of its existence.  No conscious
          development of dormant talents is possible.  However,
          exposure to powerful Psionic events or artifacts may
          stimulate a dormant talent.  Once the talent exceeds &#9733;, it
          becomes known to the person possessing it.  A dormant talent
          may reveal its nature with Psionic Episodes.  In later parts
          of the dormant stage, frequent Psionic episodes can lead to
          apprehensions that the person is insane, and may cause
          well-meaning observers to attempt cures or confinement.
          This can be awkward when the person does not know the cause
          of the problem.
        </p>
        <p>
          Once a talent develops past the dormant stage, it may be
          developed more or less normally.  The individual must
          meditate (not sleep!) for at least 8 hours of a day to gain
          new insights.  Anyone with an active Psionic talent can
          attempt to use it at anytime, provided the person is
          conscious.  Using Psionic talents is tiring, regardless,
          whether or not the attempt is successful.  Fatigue can also
          be accumulated after a Psionic episode.  Particularly
          stressing invocations may cause the invoker to fall
          unconscious and also suffers Psionic Blindness, the complete
          inability to use any Psionic talent, for several hours.
          Sometimes unpredictable and/or unanticipated results may
          occur when invoking a Psionic talent.  Possibilities for
          misfires are given in the talent descriptions.  Psionic
          episodes occur randomly but are more likely, when a talent
          is used often or for extended periods of time.
        </p>
        <p>
          Medium, Prescience, and Sensitivity are talents which may be
          stimulated by appropriate phenomena, which is called passive
          triggering.  Medium may be triggered by the presence of
          ethereals, Prescience by imminent danger, and Sensitivity by
          a Psionic or magical residue/effect.  If the stimulus is
          weak, the person is less likely to be alerted.  When
          passive triggering occurs, the owner is given minimal
          information.  If the person wants more information, the
          talent must be used actively (with fatigue being a
          consequence).
        </p>
        <p>
          Two people with the same Psionic talent may wish to pool
          their efforts in invoking the talent.  This may be done if
          skin contact is established by grasping hands, etc. and skin
          contact is maintained during the time spent invoking the
          talent.  Under unknown circumstances ritual procedure may
          need to be followed in order to form the necessary “fusion”
          between invokers.  This will become known to the affected
          invokers instinctively.
        </p>
        <p>
          The following talents are known by the guild.  No percentages
          are given, because talents are too rare to gather sufficient
          statistics.  While Psionics are more instinctive than
          spells, concepts such as Spellfire Timing, Modeling,
          Detection, Noise, and Foci, all have application.

          A Psionic talent to influence the mind of another person
          (victim).  The usual effect is to “freeze” the victim in
          place for a limited period of time. In order to invoke the
          talent successfully, eye contact between the invoker and the
          victim is necessary, but only for a momentary glance. The
          maximum distance at which effective eye contact can occur is
          approximately 10 yards.  The effect remains in place until
          the attacker stops gazing at the victim.

          The ability to visualize events currently occurring at a

          clairvoyant.  The psychic enters a trance and after the
          first minute gets a clear image of some object, person, or
          location that he is familiar with.  The image may be moving
          and is of the current state.  Sensory perception is normal
          but with narrow focus on the object.  Clairvoyance may be
          used in either of two ways: <em>Near:</em> The clairvoyant
          enters a trance to transfer their point of perception to a
          location.  The location must be familiar to the clairvoyant.
          <em>Far:</em> The clairvoyant enters a trance sand attempts
          to focus on a specific, remote person or object whose
          location may not be known.  The clairvoyant does this by
          visualizing the person’s face (or by describing the object).

          The ability to detach the ethereal spirit from the body,
          which is left in a state of metabolic suspension.  The
          disembodied spirit is referred to as an astral entity.
          Information about the abilities of astral entities is in
          Religion.  It is difficult to remain in a disembodied state
          for long.  The talent lasts for several minutes, after which
          the astral entity instantly returns to its body (even if it
          does not want to return).  If the body is vacant when the
          astral entity returns, it reunites with its body and a Shock
          Roll is then made.  If the body has been occupied by another
          ethereal while the astral entity was away, Mental Conflict
          occurs.  Disembodiment is achieved by making one’s body very
          relaxed (somewhat similar to how one falls asleep).  The
          time needed to invoke the talent is one minute.

          Sometimes called “the evil eye,” Hex is the ability to
          “curse” a victim, causing them to have bad luck.  If the
          invoker has a part of the victim (nail parings, lock of
          hair, etc.) increase Mastery.  Such items cannot be used
          more than once.  At the time the talent is invoked, the
          maximum distance between the invoker and the intended victim
          depends on whether the invoker has a part of the victim.  If
          a part is available, the maximum distance is a league.  If a
          part is unavailable, the maximum distance is line of sight.
          The psychic enters a trance and after the first minute
          reduces the victims rolls by his talent skill level.  The
          person may be moving.

          beneficial to the talent user.

          Some ethereals are beyond control.  With a win, the ethereal
          may be commanded to perform a simple task such as answer a

          but may be dissolved instantly by its creator.  The field
          requires great concentration to maintain; the invoker is in
          a trance and limited to simple activities, like walking. Any

          The ability to determine the “fate” of a group, person, or

          be symbolic in nature.  Folklore may be used to interpret
          the vision.  Some clerics and divinators specialize in
          interpretation of prescient visions.  There are two active
          forms:
        </p>
        <p>
          <em>Prescient Vision:</em> The invoker specifies the subject
          of inquiry.  The invoker enters a trance for one hour,
          during which a prescient vision occurs concerning the
          subject.  Mastery is reduced if the subject is hidden by
          magic, etc.  Normally, the invoker lacks control over the
          vision, but with &#9733;&#9733;&#9733;&#9733; or above, it is possible to direct the
          inquiry somewhat.  Prescience can only reveal likely future
          events; the future may be altered.  The trance does not
          cause fatigue.
        </p>
        <p>
          <em>Sense of Danger:</em> An attempt to assess danger in a
          specific location.  The invoker enters a trance for about a
          minute.  If successful, this gives a vague feeling of danger
          if there are traps or lurking dangers within an area that
          could reasonably be reached/accessed within the time frame
          the trance lasts.  This trance causes fatigue.

          The ability to divine information about persons by touching
          an object with which they have been in contact.  Psychometry
          requires the invoker to hold the object and enter a trance
          for a few minutes.  Psychometry is most often used to divine
          the age or history of an object, the identity of the
          object's maker or owners, magical/divine powers, etc.
          Another use is to determine a person’s location.
        </p>
        <p>
          Psychometry can never be used to divine the future.  It
          works best when queries concern the present or recent past.
          Mastery is reduced for inquiries in the distant past, or if
          knowledge of the object is magically or divinely hidden.
          The longer the vision lasts, the more information is
          obtained.  A reasonable minimum is 5 minutes. (Accrues
          fatigue.)

          the fire takes a long as it takes to throw an imaginary fire
          to the target.  It takes a bit longer when the object is
          chilled or wet.  Once the object begins to burn, the invoker
          has no control over the fire.  The talent may be used to
          warm objects to a desired temperature less than flash point,
          but bad results may cause ignition.  The talent has no
          effect on intelligent beings, including the invoker.

          Sensitivity is subject to Passive Triggering and may be used
          actively to scan for magical or Psionic residue/effects.
          Mastery may be adjusted to reflect the source and strength
          of any such effects.  Maximum range at which a
          spell/artifact/talent can be detected is usually 5 yards.
          Sensitivity can also be used to attune to magical artifacts
          or effects.  Once attunement is achieved, it usually lasts
          as long as the invoker stays within range of the

          The power to transmit thoughts or emotions to the mind of

          is invoked by concentrating on the thought/emotion for one
          minute.  The target is specified at the time transmission is
          attempted; the target’s location does not need to be known
          by the invoker.  Someone who receives an emotion will feel
          it – this can have an interesting effect.  If a person with
          the Sensitivity talent is near the target or the invoker at

          may also be transferred.  Less skilled users often lose
          things on the way.  Travel is ethereal, instantaneous, and
          takes 5 minutes in "absent mindedness".  The talent is
          fairly common among the older bloodlines of the Sindarin,
          but otherwise rare.  The invoker does not necessarily know
          where the destination will be, although it is always a

          between worlds.  Dozens exist throughout Kethira, although
          the Shava Forest on Hârn has a particularly high

          A few scholars may argue that the gods are figments of the
          imaginations of men, but most Lythians believe implicitly in
          their existence.  Hârnic society is pregnant with divine
          superstition.  In addition to the ten major deities,
          hundreds of lesser semi-divine entities are worshiped by
          Lythians.  The powers of the deities, if not infinite, are
          beyond the compass of mortals.  Demigods, on the other hand,
          are closer to humankind; their imperfections and weaknesses,
          their attitudes and objectives, may at least be comprehended
          by mortals.  Demigods are of two types: those who serve one
          of the ten great deities by choice or compulsion, and those
          who serve no master.  They vary in strength and attitude.
          Some demigods are confined to specific regions by greater
          beings or principles, some are associated with particular
          peoples or institutions, and some are semi-legendary mortal

          Each of the ten major deities have mortal adherents who have
          created religious institutions to regulate and foster their
          version of the truth.  The organization of churches vary
          greatly.  Each is detailed in the separate deity articles,
          but a few generalities can be made.  All churches have a
          clergy and laity although a few, like the Church of Naveh,
          almost totally ignore the latter.  Some laity may be
          extremely pious, but they will not be taught the higher
          rituals of the church.  The clergy are the priests and
          priestesses, those who organize and administer the temples
          and devote their lives to serving the deity.  Although often
          simple folk by birth, clerics enjoy a privileged social
          status between that of guildsmen and the nobility.  All
          churches of the ten major deities have ceremonial levels of
          knowledge called Circles of Command.  Most churches have
          seven Circles, although those without Pontiffs have only
          six.  The table below indicates offices a member of that
          Circle is qualified to hold.

          II. Circle.  Clerics are admitted to the III. Circle when
          they are ordained.  Admission to higher Circles require
          approval of at least three existing members of the desired
          Circle.  This may occur soon, or it can be delayed by years
          of political intrigue.  Churches appoint members of the
          clergy to permanent or temporary offices.  All promotions
          are controlled by those with higher office, except the
          highest office is usually the result of election by peers.
          In some churches the offices of Archbishop, Primate, and
          Pontiff are (effectively) restricted to clerics of noble
          blood.  People may apply for appointment to any vacant
          church office for which their current Circle qualifies them.
          Appointments are handled solely at GM discretion; a
          candidate’s Intrigue and Social Class are always
          significant.

          Most churches contain one or more clerical orders and most
          clerics are members of a specific order.  The lay followers
          of a deity are not required to join any particular clerical
          order, but those with martial skill often belong to fighting
          orders which are sponsored by various clerical orders.
          Clerical and fighting orders have their own hierarchies.
          Morality is a crucial attribute for clerics.  Although
          church officials may be unaware of a person’s true
          Morality, deities are not so easily fooled.  Clerics
          entering a church for which their Morality is inappropriate
          are unlikely to prosper, or even live very long.  Circles
          are ceremonial ranks, whereas offices are political ranks.
          Higher circles are evidence of a certain level of knowledge,
          but in no way guarantee promotion to higher office.  A High
          Priest is a member of at least the IV. Circle, but most
          members of the IV. Circle are simple priests.  Although
          rare, there have been cases where a VII. Circle pontiff
          retired to end his days as a simple abbey priest.

          Legally recognized churches have the right to hold their own
          courts and administer justice for a variety of religious
          crimes, including blasphemy, heresy, and witchcraft.  Temple
          courts often use trial by ordeal to determine guilt or
          innocence.  The penalties handed out vary from one church to
          another; Peonian courts rarely inflict permanent harm on
          offenders, but Agrikan courts are fond of burning at the
          stake.  Temple courts must obtain secular consent to any
          death penalties, a formality often ignored by some churches.

          There is corruption in every church.  Most churches argue
          that their clerics are infallible, but corrupt ones will be
          punished in the afterlife.  This may be of small comfort to
          a cleric who is roasted alive on false charges of heresy.
          The piety and ritual rules allow clerics to perform ritual
          invocations without piety, although pious priests can do
          them better.
        </p>

          The fragmentation of the churches resulting from pantheism
          weakens their universal influence, but their power in
          specific regions, or among some economic groups is
          significant.  The churches of Larani and Peoni dominate in
          the kingdoms of Chybisa, Kaldor, Kanday, and Melderyn.  The
          church of Agrik is prominent in the Kingdom of Rethem.
          Adherents of Save-K’nor tend to be scholars with influence
          throughout Hârn, on Melderyn in particular.  Sarajinism is
          the dominant faith of the Ivinian conquerors of Orbaal,
          while Ilvir holds some sway among their subject Jarin.  Siem
          is primarily worshiped by the Khuzdul and Sindarin, although
          each race tends to focus their faith through one of two
          demigod servants.  Halea has support from merchants and
          guildsmen in all states, but is most dominant in the Thardic
          Republic.  The churches of Morgath and Naveh have few
          adherents; both are proscribed and covert throughout most of
          Hârn, except the Church of Morgathm which has enormous
          influence in Golotha, the principal city of Rethem.

        <h3 id="piety">Piety</h3>
        <p>
          Piety is a unit of favor with a deity and religious zeal.
          People accrue Piety by performing actions publicly
          beneficial to their deity.  They expend them by publicly
          committing a sin.  Piety may also be used to increase the
          Mastery of any skill of Prayer.  Piety is dedicated to a
          single deity.  Individuals can, if they wish, maintain
          separate Piety totals for two or more deities.  Multiple
          worship is rare, especially among clerics.  Most folk fear
          this will compromise the passage of their soul when they
          die.  Remember that a major sin to Larani, might be viewed
          by Agrik as commendable.  Also remember that the viewpoint
          of a church and its deity may differ; an overzealous or
          corrupt priest might declare an action to be a major sin,
          but a deity might not agree.  Adherents of churches that
          hear confessions may be able to avoid some penalties, but
          penances are often imposed, especially on ordained clerics.
          Some people are said to have Divine Grace.  Divine Grace has
          the following important effects:
        </p>
        <p>
          Individuals with Divine Grace are deemed “worthy” of divine
          aid, and individuals without Divine Grace are “unworthy.”
          Hence, a call for divine intervention is more likely to
          succeed for those with Divine Grace.  Invocations that heal
          injuries, cure diseases, remove curses, etc., have a Special
          Bonus if the subject has Divine Grace.
          A person without Divine Grace will have difficulty
          convincing a deity to claim his spirit when he dies, forcing
          it to wonder the worlds as a shade, or to negotiate with
          another deity for acceptance.
        </p>
        <ul class="explain">
          <li>
            <em>Prayer.</em> One uninterrupted hour of prayer and/or
            meditation in an appropriate temple or on other
            consecrated ground.
          </li>
          <li>
            <em>Fasting.</em> A full day (24 hours) of fasting, which
            cannot include any other activity except prayer, sleep,
            etc.  Note: starving is not fasting; individuals must make
            a conscious decision not to eat when food is available.
          </li>
          <li>
            <em>Confession.</em> The churches of Halea, Larani,
            Morgath, Naveh, Peoni, and Save-K’nor hear confessions.
            Only confessions of “significant guilt” are worthy of
            piety.  Confessions must be made to an ordained cleric who
            (80% chance) may demand a penance.
          </li>
          <li>
            <em>Daily Mass.</em> Attendance at the daily church
            service held by most temples.  Daily Mass is generally
            held in the early evening and lasts one or more hours.
            Services may be attended by anyone.
          </li>
          <li>
            <em>Monthly Low Mass.</em> Most churches hold a special
            monthly Low Mass for the laity.  The day varies by church.
            There is no Daily Mass on this day.
          </li>
          <li>
            <em>Monthly High Mass.</em> Most churches hold a monthly
            High Mass which may be attended only by the clergy.  The
            day varies by church; most have one day a month they
            consider more holy than any other.
          </li>
          <li>
            <em>Feast Mass.</em> Held yearly on the principal holy
            day, this mass often lasts four hours.  It is usually
            followed by second service open only to clerics.  There is
            no High Mass or Daily Mass on this day.  A “feaster” is a
            name given to adherents who attend only the Feast Mass –
            it is a derogatory term.
          </li>
          <li>
            <em>Temple Service.</em> Some characters perform a minor
            task for the temple, such as cleaning out the storerooms
            or latrines.  The service usually takes a couple of days
            to perform.  Piety accrual is on completion and may vary
            with the difficulty (or unpleasantness) of the task.
          </li>
          <li>
            <em>Donation/Sacrifice.</em> People may make donations to
            temples or sacrifices to their deity.  A sacrifice must be
            appropriate to the deity.  Siem, for example, would cast
            out anyone who sacrificed a life; Morgath would be very
            pleased.  Something of high value to the individual will
            probably be more favored by the deity.
          </li>
          <li>
            <em>Quest.</em> Character agrees to perform a task in the
            service of a church and/or deity.  Individuals who
            willingly abandon the task before completion lose piety.
          </li>
          <li>
            <em>Pilgrimage.</em> Character undertakes a journey to a
            holy site of the deity.  Piety granted reflects the
            distance and danger involved.  Because the ways of deities
            are incomprehensible to mortals, the piety for any act may
            seem random.

        <h3 id="intervent">Divine Intervention</h3>
        <p>
          The motives of the gods vary.  The kind of universe desired
          by Morgath, the Lord of Chaos, is different from that wanted
          by Peoni, the gentle patron of healing.  The problem all ten
          gods face is that they cannot destroy each other without
          risking all their destructions.  Hence, the Concordat limits
          the actions that may be taken.  Conflict between the gods is
          now more or less confined to the mortal and semi-mortal
          planes of Kethira and Yashain.  Siem has withdrawn to the
          Blessed Realm, and Ilvir broods alone at Araka-Kalai.
          Halea, Naveh, Save-K’nor, and Sarajin have established their
          neutrality, although each favors varying degrees of order
          and chaos.  Peoni is effectively a non-combatant.  Larani
          stands, essentially alone, against Morgath and Agrik.  These
          two evil deities have not formed an alliance, but it is
          their works that Larani tries to undo.  These divisions are
          not simply based on morality.  The quasi-war between Larani
          and the dark pair is more complex than a simple epic.
          Agrik, and especially Morgath, represent a degree of chaos,
          a breaking down of order that would greatly change the
          worlds.  To prevent total chaos, and enforce the Concordat,
          the other gods support Larani to survive, but not to win.
          To prevent all-out war, there is a Concordat limiting the
          interference of deities in the affairs of lesser
          beings. Although mortals cannot know the truth or nature of
          these limits, the following principles, hotly debated by
          theologians, have evolved to justify the limitations of the
          gods.  These principles are not always followed precisely by
          the deities, are often violated by demigods, and certainly
          do not apply to mortal adherents.
        </p>
        <ul class="explain">
          <li>
            <em>Principle of Ineluctability:</em> A mortal mind cannot

          <li>
            <em>Principle of Transpotence:</em> Since there is more
            than one deity, and lethal conflict between them is

          </li>
          <li>
            <em>Principle of Interference:</em> Deities do not take
            direct action against the adherents of another deity.

            those of another deity.

          Divine Intervention is an attempt to enlist the aid of a
          deity to perform a miracle.  Interventions are implemented
          by gods; if they choose to respond at all, they decide what
          to do.  A deity may be open to suggestion, but will not take
          kindly to demands.  A person may call for Divine
          Intervention at any time.  A call for intervention may be
          anything from, “Please help us out of this terrible mess” to
          “Please tell me the contents of this box.”  There are no
          limits, just consequences.  An individual calling for Divine
          Intervention must have at least &#9733; Piety for that deity.
          Each deity has a base chance of 20% to intervene. (These
          statistics are collected by the individual churches and are
          <em>highly</em> subjective and significantly favor their own
          deity.  Still, the average across all ten major deities is
          presented.  The data should therefore be taken with a pound
          of salt.)  Piety from two or more individuals may be
          combined; each may make a separate call.  Calls that are
          trivial or unethical (for that deity) are always unworthy.
          Conversely, a call to do something the deity would probably
          want anyway is more likely to succeed and worthy.  Note:
          Ritual skill plays no part in Divine Intervention. A pious
          layman has more chance of Divine Intervention than an
          impious cleric of high ritual.  Deities are averse to
          leaving direct evidence of their actions or even of their
          existence.  When a deity intervenes, it is generally
          impossible to prove an intervention has actually occurred.
          Virtually any intervention can be explained away as just as
          coincidence, the normal workings of nature, etc.
        </p>
        <p>
          If the call for intervention succeeds, a 60% chance is
          estimated for the deity to impose conditions for the aid.
          The caller is given a task to fulfill in exchange for the
          intervention.  Such tasks vary from minor services that must
          be undertaken within a year.  Any condition and
          non-compliance penalty depend on the deity, the importance
          of the intervention, and so on.  Refusal to fulfill a
          Condition is unwise.
        </p>
        <p>
          If the call for intervention fails, a 20% chance is
          estimated to see if the deity exacts some kind of
          Retribution on the caller.  If a retribution occurs the
          deity not only fails to help, but also inflicts some curse
          or penance.
        </p>
        <p>
          A call to a demigod increases the chance of Intervention by
          10, but also increases the chance of Conditions by 20, or
          the chance of Retribution by 10.  Individuals may pray in
          the hope of gaining the favor of their deity for any
          endeavor.  Prayers take between one second and one minute
          usually. The effect is to increase the Mastery in some skill
          by a few points. Success varies with time and piety
          involved.

        <h3 id="ethereals">Ethereals</h3>
        <p>
          Between this world (Kethira) and the next (Yashain) stands a
          shadowy “half world” known by many names, but most often as
          the Astral Plane or the Spirit World.  Ethereals are
          spiritual entities, capable of existing on this Astral
          Plane, and moving between it and Kethira or Yashain.
          Kethira, Yashain, and the Astral Plane all exist in the same
          or nearby physical space.  Passing through solid objects by
          an Ethereal is called “frooshing.”  For many ethereals, this
          is unpleasant and/or tiring.  A corporeal creature
          “frooshed” by an ethereal usually experiences an eerie,
          shivering sensation.
        </p>
        <p>
          <em>Astrals.</em> An astral is a disembodied spirit,
          typically created by the use of the Disembodiment Psionic
          talent or the Transcendence ritual invocation.  An astral
          maintains strong empathy with its own body because it must
          leave at least a portion of its Aura behind to avoid death.
          Because of this link, an astral entity always knows the
          distance and direction to its native body, and is always
          aware of any in the status of that body.  A vacated body is
          comatose in a state of metabolic suspension.  The body is
          subject to normal physical injury and can die during the
          absence of its astral.  Should this occur, the resident and
          astral portions of Aura will immediately dissolute and
          reform as one entity in double the normal time.  An astral
          may return and repossess its own (living) body without
          difficulty, but fatigue is accumulated in the ethereal
          state.  An astral may also return to find its body has been
          possessed by an alien spirit.
        </p>
        <p>
          <em>Shades (Ghosts).</em> A shade is created when: The
          physical body of an astral traveler dies; a person dies
          without Divine Grace and the spirit is unclaimed by any of
          the gods; a person dies in circumstances which require a
          “great wrong” to be righted before the spirit can “rest.”  A
          shade may wander the world(s), but most often haunts the
          scene of its death until the “great wrong” is righted, or
          they are admitted to an afterlife by one of the gods.
        </p>
        <p>
          <em>Natural Ethereals.</em> These are entities whose natural
          state is ethereal.  They originate on the Astral Plane, most
          often by powerful sorcery or divine will, but may have a
          physical form on some other plane.  Divine and semi-divine
          entities are natural ethereals, as are most elementals.
          Some entities are able to de-materialize their physical
          bodies and become entirely ethereal by an act of will, or by
          arcane means.  De-materialization has the advantage of
          avoiding the risks of leaving a body behind while the spirit
          travels.  This ability is evidence for the view, held by
          many scholars, that the mortal body is simply a convenient
          physical manifestation of the immortal Aura.  This theory,
          if true, means that all creatures are really natural
          ethereals because their immortal state is ethereal.
        </p>
        <p>
          Although usually referred to in the singular, the Astral
          Plane is really an almost infinite number of shifting and
          overlapping planes.  Although movement between astral planes
          is almost instantaneous, only divine entities can hope to
          navigate this “ethereal maze” with any degree of speed or
          accuracy.
        </p>
        <p>
          Ethereals have no physical attributes and cannot see, hear,
          smell, touch, or taste things in a physical sense.  They
          possess only non-physical attributes and abilities,
          including spells and invocations.  Ethereals have the
          Psionic talents of Telepathy and Sensitivity.  They are able
          to directly perceive and communicate with each other, and
          with a corporeal entity bearing these talents.  Their
          sensitivity to Aura also allows them to view all living
          things as a hazy image, day or night.  When moving on the
          same plane, astrals and shades travel as a fast runner would
          and pass through solid objects at will - which is fortunate
          since they cannot see any Aura-less objects.  Natural
          ethereals, especially if winged, can generally move faster
          than this.
        </p>
        <p>
          Ethereals are not subject to physical fatigue, but may
          accrue mental fatigue by using spells or Psionic talents. An
          ethereal may only use talents or spells which do not involve
          physical action on its part.  All Masteries while
          disembodied are subject to fatigue.  Ethereals cannot be
          destroyed.  They are immune to injury except when inflicted
          by enchanted weapons, magic, Psionic talents, or divine
          intervention.  If subjected to esoteric harm, injury is
          translated into fatigue.  Ethereals cannot recover fatigue
          except by dissolution.  Dissolution is the scattering of an
          ethereal’s “substance.”  It reforms in several hours at the
          location of the ethereal’s physical body (if it has one),
          otherwise in a random location or plane.  When the process
          is complete, the ethereal regains consciousness and has no
          fatigue.
        </p>
        <p>
          The natural state of ethereals is invisible.  They can
          become translucent at will, but doing so accrues normal
          Fatigue per minute.  This accumulation of fatigue does not
          by itself cause dissolution, but will increase the
          ethereal’s susceptibility to dissolution.  An ethereal may
          possess a live body by winning a mental conflict with the
          resident Aura.  Possession is easier if part of the native
          Aura is absent as an astral.  A possessed body acquires the
          personality attributes of the invading spirit, while
          physical attributes are unchanged.  All disembodied
          inidviduals have Telepathy and Sensitivity Psionic talents
          during their ethereal state. These talents are dormant in
          all creatures with Aura.  Kethira, Yashain, and the Astral
          Planes all exist in the same or nearby physical space.
          Movement between these planes is almost instantaneous,
          assuming the traveler knows the paths to take which is never
          easy given the ever-shifting nature of the Astral planes.
          An ethereal move applies only to movement on the same plane.
          The risk of having a stranger establish squatter’s rights in
          the “temple of one’s body” is one of the greater hazards of
          astral travel.  From an astral’s perspective, this is akin
          to breaking into someone’s house, eating the food, drinking
          the wine, trying on the clothes, beating the servants, and
          bedding the spouse.  A vanquished native spirit may attempt
          to regain its own body with a new Mental Conflict after the
          normal period of Dissolution.  An ongoing struggle between
          the invading and native spirit may cause further personality
          switches.  Ethereals may also possess the body of a recently
          dead creature, thus creating a Zombie.

        <h3 id="afterlife">Afterlife</h3>
        <p>
          Each person has a soul, the non-physical portion of the
          person.  When the body dies, the soul journeys to its
          afterlife.  Most people commit their soul to one god who
          takes possession of the soul upon death.  Those who die
          godless, or out of Divine Grace with their god, embark on a
          Death Journey unless “saved” by a funeral rite.  All clerics
          are taught Passage of the Soul, a funeral ritual to help a
          soul make a swift journey to its afterlife.  Although
          funerals vary from church to church and from region to
          region, the basic pattern is the same; a priest of shaman
          performs the ritual to get the attention of the god.  Then
          the priest orchestrates a prayer (often sung) to confer a
          state of Divine Grace upon the deceased by gathering Piety
          from the attendees.  Those who do not attain sufficient
          piety for Divine Grace are on their own as they make the
          Death-Journey.

          <em>Agrikans</em> practice ritual cremation.  Ashes are
          scattered outdoors or interred in temple vaults, depending
          on the importance of the deceased to the church.
        </p>
        <p>
          <em>Haleans</em> practice mummification and lay their dead
          in elaborate tombs surrounded by their worldly goods.
          However, such rites must be paid for (lavishly).  Haleans
          are cremated if they cannot afford the rituals.
        </p>
        <p>
          <em>Ilvirans</em> desire to have their mortal remains taken
          to Araka-Kalai, but few followers are so honored.  Most
          Ilvirans are quietly buried.  Because of their belief in
          reincarnation, the internment occurs at dusk and the grave
          is unmarked.
        </p>
        <p>
          <em>Laranians</em> abhor cremation.  Wealthy families
          encrypt their dead in family vaults or communal temple
          vaults.  Those who cannot afford this kind of treatment like
          to be buried on a battlefield, preferably one where they
          have fought.
        </p>
        <p>
          <em>Morgathians</em> are the most sophisticated tomb
          builders on Lythia.  They inter their dead in vast,
          extensive catacombs.  In regions where the church is
          outlawed, covert temples to the Lord of the Undead have
          vaults where the Morgathian dead (and, it is said, undead)
          are laid.
        </p>
        <p>
          <em>Navehan</em> clerics are rumored to eat their dead.  Lay
          followers often practice ritual cremation, but other methods
          are sometimes used.  The Navehans seem to have little
          reverence for their dead, reserving their respect for the
          shade of the deceased instead.

        <p>
          <em>Peonianism</em> is mainly a religion of rural folk.
          Burial is the common practice, and most Peonian graveyards
          are found adjacent to the parish church, or on a nearby
          hillside.
        </p>
        <p>
          <em>Sarajinians</em> prefer cremation, or burial in stone
          crypts, a habit they probably acquired from the Khuzdul.  In
          either case, they like a selection of their worldly goods to
          accompany them (it is no longer the practice for a warrior’s
          wives and thralls to accompany him).  Wealthy Ivinians like
          to be buried in a boat, sometimes set ablaze, sometimes
          placed in a stone tomb.
        </p>
        <p>
          <em>Save-K’norans</em> practice cremation.  Their ashes are
          then placed in a small urn that is buried.  A riddle or
          puzzle which reveals the location of the urn is engraved on
          a small memorial plaque, which is then incorporated into
          some stonework within a temple or its compound.  Solving the
          riddle may find the mortal remains, and a trinket or two to
          encourage the game, but this obliges the finder to mention
          the deceased in the finder’s own “death-riddle.”
        </p>
        <p>
          <em>Siemians</em> do not believe in using land for graves or
          memorials.  The Sindarin cremate their dead and scatter the
          ashes in a forest.  The Khuzan practice is to entomb their
          deceased in stone; but, if this is not practical, cremation
          is preferred to burial in earth.

          The Death-Journey can be long and fraught with peril,
          depending upon how far a person is out of Divine Grace and
          is a series of encounters which continue until the unclaimed
          soul acquires sufficient piety for Divine Grace or until it
          is captured and taken to a deity.  Each encounter
          automatically starts hostile, although it need not end that
          way, and a character might even gain an ally to escort him
          on his Death-Journey.  Use the Mental Conflict rules to
          resolve encounters along the Death-Journey.  If the
          individual defeats an ethereal of the same species, it can
          take possession of the physical body (if any) and end the
          Death-Journey.

          <em>Ghost:</em> souls that have not completed their
          Death-Journey.  They may wait in one place performing what
          acts they can to build the Piety they need to make their
          journey.  Ghosts may help or hinder the journeyer.  The
          winner of any mental conflict steals of the loser’s piety.
          The conflict resolution separates the contestant on the
          Astral plane, so a repeated encounter is unlikely.
        </p>
        <p>
          <em>Demigod:</em> a random servitor of one of the gods.  The
          demigod will immediately engage in Mental Conflict.  If
          successful, the demigod brings the lost soul to its master.
          If the random demigod is a servant of the lost soul’s deity,
          the soul is admitted to its afterlife.

          <em>Ethereal Ivashu:</em> Ilvir has some Ivashu that roam

        <p>
          <em>Ethereal Humanoid:</em> A human shaman or Shek-Pvar in
          an ethereal state.  May help or hinder the journeyer.  A

        <p>
          Spells and ritual invocations should never be confused.
          Clerics seek to draw the deity’s attention by performing a
          ritual, and encourage intervention by limiting the call to a
          specific effect but, ultimately, they depend on their deity
          to act.  Spellcasting, on the other hand, involves powers
          released by a mage from the fundament of Kelestia and
          requires no divine intervention.  Mages are generally
          offended by any suggestion that a spell is miraculous.
          Conversely, any claim that a ritual invocation is a spell
          would be construed by most clerics as an admission of
          blasphemy.
        </p>
        <p>
          Ritual is a skill which reflects an individual’s knowledge of
          church dogma, holy scriptures, chants, songs, and mysteries.
          There is a separate Ritual Skill for each deity.  It is used
          by clerics for performing ritual invocations.  Individuals
          may, theoretically, have Ritual for two or more deities.
          Learning Rituals assumes the individual in question has
          received some basic instruction in the church mysteries and
          been baptized into the faith.  Ritual Mastery can only be
          improved by learning new invocations, reading Holy Tomes, or
          performing an invocation in an adverse situation or in
          ritual church duty.
        </p>
        <p>
          Ritual invocations are ceremonies that “encourage” a deity
          to intervene with a miracle.  They originated as a means for
          clerics to impress their laity or potential converts.  These
          uses are still practiced, but many invocations work equally
          well (often better) to subdue those who oppose a cleric’s
          deity.  Such use is tacitly approved by all churches, since
          the “proxy wars” of mortals is an acceptable method of
          conflict among deities.  Theoretically, anyone may learn the
          rituals of any Circle, but most churches will teach them
          only to ordained priests.  The rituals were once closely
          associated with a specific circle, higher rituals being the
          exclusive knowledge of higher circles.  They are still
          classified in this way, but “leakage” of knowledge over the
          centuries has eroded this restriction.  Today, the
          invocations of any Circle can be taught to any ordained
          priest.
        </p>
        <p>
          People may perform any invocation they know.
          Invocations can be learned in one of three ways: from a
          mentor, from holy scriptures, or by divine revelation.
        </p>
        <ul class="explain">
          <li>
            <em>Mentor training.</em> Most invocations are learned
            from another cleric who knows it.  Both the student and
            mentor must be fluent (&#9733;&#9733;&#9733;) in a shared language.
          </li>
          <li>
            <em>Holy Scriptures.</em> There are a wide variety of holy
            writings, parables, songs, poems, and teachings that can
            be thought of as Holy Scriptures.  Church archives are
            filled with such written works and clerics consult them to
            expand their knowledge of dogma and ritual.  Invocations
            can be learned from Holy Scriptures if they are written in
            a known language and script, or a reliable translator must
            be available.
          </li>
          <li>
            <em>Divine Revelation.</em> In rare cases, a deity may
            wish to provide knowledge of an invocation to any
            adherent, perhaps even a lay adherent.  Such revelations
            are handled at GM discretion, but are only likely to occur
            if an individual succeeds on a Divine Intervention roll.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          To learn an invocation, a person must spend 5 days per
          Circle. That is, for a III Circle invocation, a person
          spends 15 days. (The number of watches it takes is 45.)
        </p>
        <p>
          It should not be assumed that clerics are the only people
          with access to ritual invocations.  The Morgathian Prophet
          Balsha, for example, received no formal training in the
          tenets of the Morgathian Church, yet miracles were invoked
          in his presence.  Most clerics feel a prophet appears when a
          church needs to be steered away from a path of action which
          does not please its deity.  Of course, one person’s prophet
          is another person’s heretic.
        </p>
        <p>
          Temples are always consecrated ground, and certain areas
          such as crypts and graveyards can be made holy to a specific
          deity by the ritual invocation Consecration.  Peoni and
          Larani are allied and oppose Agrik.  Morgath, the Lord of
          Chaos, opposes everyone, but can be, in some circumstances,
          “allied” with Agrik.  All other gods are neutral, but tend
          to favor Peoni and Larani.  An invocation call usually
          consists of a quick prayer or chant, but can involve (if
          time permits) construction of an altar, burning of incense,
          an appropriate sacrifice, etc.  The intent is to perform a
          ritual which is less likely to annoy the deity.  It is said
          the powers of Naveh and Morgath arise at night and slumber
          in the light, and those of Sarajin are highest amid ice and
          snow.

          An invocation to allow adherents of the same deity to
          voluntarily transfer piety to the invoker.  The intent is to
          give the cleric more piety for any desired use.  All donors
          of piety must touch the invoker.  Takes 15 minutes and
          grants Piety.  This additional Piety is lost like fatigue.

          Artifacts store a known invocation for instant activation on
          command.  Cleric determines the number of charges to install
          – each charge takes a casting time of 5 minutes times the
          Circle.  Hence, storing three charges of a Circle V
          invocation cost 3 x 5 x 5 = 75 minutes.  Use of an artifact
          generally requires some sort of triggering or activation.
          Most often, this is done by speaking (or thinking of) a
          particular key word or phrase.  Invoking the ritual requires

          The casting time is 2 minutes for each square yard to be

          essence of this four volume treatise is captured here.  It
          is treasured among scholars.
        </p>
        <h3 id="combat-data">Combat Data</h3>
        <p>
          <em>Weapon:</em> Some weapons are restricted by region,
          race, and custom.  (C) Chivalric (noble) Weapon; (T)
          Tool/Peasant weapon; (M) Also missile weapon, data given
          here is for use as Melee weapon, for use as Missile weapon
          see later; (R) Rare Weapon (on Hârn); (G) Gargun Weapon; (S)
          Sindarin Weapon; (L) Long Weapon.  Attacks at 5 foot range
          and cannot Attack closer.
        </p>
        <p>
          <em>Skill:</em> Combat Skill to use the weapon.
        </p>
        <p>
          <em>WT:</em> Weight of the weapon in pounds.  Trace items
          (arrows, slingstones, etc) are presumed to weigh 0.1 pounds
          each.
        </p>
        <p>
          <em>WQ:</em> Weapons are rated for quality.  Sturdy
          all-metal weapons like swords have higher ratings than
          hafted weapons like spears.  WQ represents the chance a
          weapon breaks in certain combat situations.  Higher quality
          weapons cost more.
        </p>
        <p>
          <em>HM:</em> Hand Mode penalties.  All weapons, except Bows
          and Blowguns, can be used one-handed.  There is no bonus for
          two-handed use, but some weapons are penalized when used
          one-handed.  Unless a person is ambidextrous, all weapons
          (except Shields) used in the secondary hand (left hand for
          most) also have a Hand Mode Special Penalty.
        </p>
        <p>
          <em>B/E/P:</em> The impact (damage) of a weapon when it
          strikes.  Weapons may have impact ratings for two or three
          Aspects: Blunt (B), Edge (E), and Point (P).  A - rating
          indicates the weapon does not have this Aspect.  A zero (0)
          rating means the weapon has the Aspect, but impact is +0.
          Point aspects in brackets are optional; if chosen, WQ is
          reduced by one (1).  This is a "weapon-build" option.
        </p>
        <p>
          <em>Price:</em> The retail price for average quality
          weapons.  Higher quality weapons roughly double in price for
          each addition point in WQ.  The source for weapons is a
          Weaponcrafter, except F (Fletcher), H (Hideworker), M
          (Metalsmith), or W (Woodcrafter).  Individuals with related
          craft skills can make/repair their own weapons, but rarely
          with WQs as high as listed.

        <p>
          Armour can be defined as any article of clothing capable of
          reducing the damage done by weapon strikes.  Even plain
          cloth can help to prevent a blade from cutting.  Higher
          levels of armour protection cost significant amounts of
          money and the extra weight carried increases Encumbrance.
          The nature of this trade-off between armour types tends to
          reflect economic and technological realities, although
          cultural preferences are also a determinant.  Some cultures
          favor heavy armour, others prefer light armour, and a few
          consider wearing any armour to be cowardly.  Climate is also
          a consideration; wearing heavy, padded armours in a tropical
          climate is simply too exhausting to be practical.  Different
          types of armour are usually worn in overlapping layers, such
          as Surcoat (cloth) over Mail over Quilt.  The protective
          values of each layer are added together to determine total
          protection.  Moreover, some body parts may benefit from two
          layers of the same material.  For example, a warrior wearing
          a Mail hauberk and leggings, has double mail coverage for
          the Thigh, Groin, and Abdomen.
        </p>
        <p>
          Combatants must find a balance between the protection
          offered by armour and the Encumbrance penalty it brings.
          Mail, Scale, and Plate armours are heavy.  It may be
          tempting to wear multiple layers of Cloth or Quilt, but this
          is highly encumbering and especially fatiguing on a hot day.
          Each extra layer of Cloth or Quilt (except where they
          naturally occur from overlapping garments) incurrs a Special
          Penalty.

          The table assumes average quality (0) materials.  Armour
          materials can be purchased at higher or lower qualities.
          The effect of these ratings (maximum +4) is to increase or
          decrease all protective values by the quality rating.  That
          is, a +1 mail Hauberk has protective values of B3, E9, P6,
          and F2.  No armour aspect can be reduced below one (1).
          Some Jmorvi Shek-Pvar with weaponcraft skill can produce
          enchanted armour.  Such pieces are rare and have +1 quality
          per level of enchantment.

            <em>Cloth:</em> heavy, coarse cloth, typically buckram or
            serge, worn over or under other types of armour, or alone
            as everyday garb.  Fine linen clothing offers negligible
            armour protection.

          <li>
            <em>Quilt:</em> two layers of cloth, stuffed with wool or
            straw, then stitched together.  It is equivalent to Fur

        <p>
          Strike location is important for two main reasons.  First,
          only the armour worn at the location struck is relevant.
          Second, injury effects vary by location; a blow to the skull
          is more serious than a blow to the foot.  The percentages
          allocated to body parts do not reflect the relative size of
          that part, since the head, arms, or groin are favored
          targets.  Combatants can influence Strike Location by
          targeting their aim.  Although combatants instinctively turn
          to face the most imminent threat, some armour only covers
          part of a strike location - a breastplate, for example, only
          covers the front of the thorax and abdomen.  In random
          situation, where it is hard to determine whether the front
          or back of a strike location is struck, experience shows
          there is a 75% chance of being struck on the front side.  An
          asterisk (*) indicates that Stumble or Fumbles may apply.

        <h3 id="morale">Morale</h3>
        <p>
          A battle is a noisy, confusing, scary place.  The clash of
          arms, shouting, screaming (often some whimpering and dull
          thudding) can make it difficult to hear commands and cries
          for help.  For this reason combatants do not always do what
          their superiors want them to do.  Battle experience,
          discipline, and morale are three ambiguous, but important,
          elements in any battle.  All these factors are accounted for
          by Morale, which benefits individuals with high Morale and
          is detrimental to combatants with low Morale.  Having been
          prone in a Combat situation applies a penalty of &#9733;&#9733; to Horse
          Morale, which fades away.
        </p>
        <p>
          <em>Normal:</em> A combatant with normal morale behaves
          without constraint, selecting and executing any reasonable
          action option.
        </p>
        <p>
          <em>Cautious:</em> A cautious character will not Engage,
          must choose Pass if engaged, and will not Counterstrike.
        </p>
        <p>
          <em>Desperate:</em> Combatant tries to conclude the battle,
          one way or the other, as soon as possible.  Until the
          situation changes and a new Morale Test is passed, the
          combatant selects the most aggressive option available.
        </p>
        <p>
          <em>Broken:</em> The individual is unable to fight in any
          useful way.  The only available options are flight or
          surrender.  Flight is normally preferable; surrender is a
          last resort.  If neither is feasible, the individual makes a
          Rest or Pass action option, but can defend if attacked
          except that Counterstrike is prohibited.

          <em>Rally:</em> The indivudual has enough character to
          support others in their Morale.  He may provide his success
          to Morale rolls of others he can communicate with.  This is
          valid for a synchronous Morale roll only.  This may be
          augmented by Rhetoric.
        </p>
        <p>
          <em>Berserk:</em> This is a special state of battle-frenzy.
          Any combatant who enters this mode will take the most
          aggressive action available for Attack or Defense, adding &#9733;
          to Attack Mastery subtracting &#9733; from Mastery to defend.
          Further Morale rolls are ignored until the battle ends.
          Some combatants may have a cultural heritage of berserking,
          or a particular reason to go berserk.

        <h3 id="wounds">Wounds</h3>
        <p>
          Combatants who sustain Serious or Grievous wounds may die
          during the healing routine.  On the other hand, various
          types of magic, miracles, Psionics, and potions can improve
          healing.  The following wound types exist and individual
          wounds are tracked with their location.  Effects on the use
          of the corresponding part are described below.
        </p>
        <p>
          <em>&#9733;:</em> Minor.  Wounds only have wound
          penalty.
        </p>
        <p>
          <em>&#9733;&#9733;:</em> Serious. Wounds of this type also
          have minor effects on neighbouring detailed body parts at
          &#9733; less.  Any activity involving these body parts are
          at the appropriate penalty.  These “effect” wounds do not
          heal separately.
        </p>
        <p>
          <em>&#9733;&#9733;&#9733;:</em> Grievous.  The detailed body part
          cannot be used, serious use effects on neighbouring detailed
          body parts, and minor on main parts.  These “effect” wounds
          do not heal separately.  Minor effects are at &#9733;&#9733;
          less than the Grievous, while serious are &#9733; less.
        </p>
        <p>
          <em>&#9733;&#9733;&#9733;&#9733;:</em> Incapacitating, the
          main body part cannot be used, serious use effects on
          neighbouring main body parts.  (For head this means
          unconsciousness and for thorax imminent death.)  Serious
          effects are at &#9733;&#9733; less than the Incapacitating.
        </p>
        <p>
          <em>&#9733;&#9733;&#9733;&#9733;&#9733;:</em> Destroyed, the main body part lost
          its integrity, Grievous use effects on neighbouring main
          body parts.  (For limbs this means at least severed.  Thorax
          is split open or spinal cord severed.  For all but the
          extremities this means instant death.  For all other body
          parts, death is probably imminent due to the side effects.)
          Grievous use effects are at &#9733;&#9733; less than the
          Destroyed.
        </p>
        <p>
          <em>Fumble/Stumble:</em> A wound level &#9733; above
          Dexterity on an arm causes any object held to be dropped, a
          Fumble.  A wound level &#9733; above Agility on a leg
          causes the victim to fall down, a Stumble.  A character with
          wound level of less than &#9733;&#9733; above Dexterity is
          eligible for a Grope action to pick up any object dropped.
          A character that dropped to a Stumble but with a wound less
          than &#9733;&#9733; above Agility is likewise able to get
          back up.  If the wound level exceeds these &#9733;&#9733; the pain and
          structural damage preclude recovery.
        </p>
        <p>
          Any wound needs to heal its injury points.  This depends on
          Stamina; medicine may improve the healing rate.  A physician
          may attempt to find or create the correct medicine but his
          skill does not add to the healing directly.  A serious wound
          may become infected until it turns into a minor wound.  An
          infection is a daily attack on the wounded area with a level
          of the wound, defended against with Stamina.  Medicine
          applies in the same way as for minor wounds, but it harder
          to obtain.  A penalty of &#9733; is suitable.  Any
          injury points gained through the infection is added to the
          original wound.  This may turn the wound into a grievous
          wound.  A grievous wound is a bleeder or otherwise makes the
          body lose vital fluids.  Bloodloss is treated as a separate
          injury.  Note that the circulatory system is incapacitated
          with points in excess of &#9733;&#9733;&#9733; as other body
          parts are.  The circulatory system itself will not turn
          infectious.  Treatment by physicians depend on the location.
          Some locations are incurable by Hârnic physicians.  For
          multiple bleeders only take the maximum in the same
          extremity, but add those for different extremities.
          Incapacitating and destroying wounds have no additional
          effects over the bleeder and infection dangers.
        </p>
        <p>
          The healing routine assumes a character will mainly be
          resting during the healing process.  If a character gets
          involved in unreasonable physical exertion during Healing,
          the days of rest accumulated since the last day are forfeit;
          wounds are often aggravated or reopened by premature
          activity.  Injury and Encumbrance penalties are ignored
          during Healing.  Fatigue penalty (if any) are applied –
          injured characters are supposed to get lots of rest.
        </p>
        <p>
          The standard treatments mostly known by all still need to be
          applied and detailed, so a physician's diagnosis is always
          necessary.  “Destroyed” wounds may be treated as
          incapacitating, with a Bonus on Diagnosis of &#9733;.
          Note that the usage effects on bordering regions needs to be
          treated as well.

          Fire and internal system damage is treated as frost, but
          some treatments may not be applied, because they will kill
          the patient.  I.e. cleaning and dressing an internal organ
          is not possible for Hârnic medicine.  A secondary treatment
          to sterilize and seal a Minor or Serious wound is
          Cauterization.  It cannot be used on Grievous or worse
          wounds.  The procedure is done after a wound’s treatment has
          been established by the normal treatment rules.  A metallic
          object and fire are required.  Cauterization is attempted at
          Physician Mastery add &#9733;.  The effect is to close
          the wound and modify the Healing Rate a second time.
          Cauterization cannot be undone or re-attempted.  It always
          leaves a nasty, broad scare and Comeliness effects may be
          applicable.  Amputations and immediate cauterizations stop
          infections.
        </p>
        <p>
          Diseases and Toxins come in various forms.  All of the below
          characteristics are subject to improvements by a
          knowledgeable physician.  Some poisons and ailments may be
          subject to infections.  <em>Deterioration:</em> This is the
          speed at which wound points are accrued.  This can be
          modified by Stamina.  <em>Maximum Injury:</em> The maximum
          amount of injury the wound will cause, after deterioration
          has set in.  Note that healing may prevent the maximum to
          actually be reached.  <em>Heal time:</em> This is the speed at
          which wound points are reduced.  Assume this to set in at
          the same time deterioration sets in.
