        <p>
          According to the general rule, <em>p5</em> divided by two
          determines <em>severity</em>.  Severity can be taken or
          mitigated with appropriate skill at base difficulty 20.
          Determine whether it can be worsened, the full effect is 10.
          E.g. a severity 5 implies difficulty 25 and only reaching a
          result of 15 mean full severity and depending on
          circumstances, a 5 result could mean up to twice the
          severity effects.
        </p>
        <p>
          Personal is usually physical penalty.  Equipment is usually
          loss as percentage of net value, e.g. -5 is 5% of value
          loss.  Value is one traveller's net worth. Transport is time
          loss in percentage.  E.g. -5 is 5% time loss until
          compensated.  Plant may mean wilderness skill failure, such
          as Foraging, with effect equivalent to time or value as
          before.  Animal or human encounters are effectively time
          loss or wounds.  The first one through rhetorics, discussing
          mute points, detainment, etc.. The second one through
          exchanging non-lethal blows and being stopped at the right
          point.
        </p>
        <p>
          Severity will be 5-added, which is why group travel is
          generally preferable.  GM will "spread" penalties.
        </p>
        <p>
          To avoid the default penalty, i.e. "play it out", apply this
          rule of thumb: roll Awareness vs 20 for the PCs to become
          aware of the danger in time.  If aware, the penalty can
          usually be avoided with an appropriate skill roll, also
          against 20.  Otherwise the effects may be mitigated by skill
          rolls similar to the healing pattern.

          Use 5 point classification for <em>Standard, Common,
          Uncommon, Rare</em>, assuming the skill is used to find the
          most valuable herb.  Standard herbs are those used for teas,
          tasty chewing, etc. and worth little more than maybe a beer
          even in large quantities.  They provide a bonus of up to 5
          for motivation, supress up to 5 physical penalty for a few
          minutes, etc.  Even these small herbs may cause lesser
          effects over time or even dependency.  Think tea or raw
          coffee.
        </p>
        <p>
          Add all herbs in one category and randomize.  Ater that
          determine season.  Two month out of season reduces potency
          by half, because the herb is either not ripe or already
          withered.  More than that potency is zero.  In border times
          give 10% for each day.  I.e. ten days late or early equals
          0%/50% potency and ten days in (out) season equals 50%/100%.
